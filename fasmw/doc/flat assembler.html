Introduction<br>
</h2>
<p class="smalltext">
This chapter contains all the most important information you need to begin
using the flat assembler. If you are experienced assembly language programmer,
you should read at least this chapter before using this compiler.
</p>

<h3 id="1.1" class="mediumtext">1.1  Compiler overview</h3>
<p class="smalltext">
Flat assembler is a fast assembly language compiler for the x86 architecture
processors, which does multiple passes to optimize the size of generated
machine code. It is self-compilable and versions for different operating
systems are provided. All the versions are designed to be used from the system
command line and they should not differ in behavior.
</p>

<h4 id="1.1.1" class="smalltext">1.1.1  System requirements</h4>
<p class="smalltext">
All versions require the x86 architecture 32-bit processor (at least 80386),
although they can produce programs for the x86 architecture 16-bit processors,
too. DOS version requires an OS compatible with MS DOS 2.0 and either true
real mode environment or DPMI. Windows version requires a Win32 console
compatible with 3.1 version.
</p>

<h4 id="1.1.2" class="smalltext">1.1.2  Executing compiler from command line</h4>
<p class="smalltext">
To execute flat assembler from the command line you need to provide two
parameters - first should be name of source file, second should be name of
destination file. If no second parameter is given, the name for output
file will be guessed automatically. After displaying short information about the program name
and version, compiler will read the data from source file and compile it.
When the compilation is successful, compiler will write the generated code
to the destination file and display the summary of compilation process;
otherwise it will display the information about error that occurred.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
In the command line you can also include <code>-m</code> option followed by a number,
which specifies how many kilobytes of memory flat assembler should maximally
use. In case of DOS version this options limits only the usage of extended
memory. The <code>-p</code> option followed by a number can be used to specify the limit
for number of passes the assembler performs. If code cannot be generated
within specified amount of passes, the assembly will be terminated with an
error message. The maximum value of this setting is 65536, while the default
limit, used when no such option is included in command line, is 100.

</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The source file should be a text file, and can be created in any text
editor. Line breaks are accepted in both DOS and Unix standards, tabulators
are treated as spaces.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
There are no command line options that would affect the output of compiler,
flat assembler requires only the source code to include the information it
really needs. For example, to specify output format you specify it by using the
<code>format</code> directive at the beginning of source.
</p>

<h4 id="1.1.3" class="smalltext">1.1.3  Compiler messages</h4>
<p class="smalltext">
As it is stated above, after the successful compilation, the compiler displays
the compilation summary. It includes the information of how many passes was
done, how much time it took, and how many bytes were written into the
destination file.
The following is an example of the compilation summary:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">flat assembler  version 1.70 (16384 kilobytes memory)
38 passes, 5.3 seconds, 77824 bytes.
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
In case of error during the compilation process, the program will display an
error message. For example, when compiler can't find the input file, it will
display the following message:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">flat assembler  version 1.70 (16384 kilobytes memory)
error: source file not found.
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
If the error is connected with a specific part of source code, the source line
that caused the error will be also displayed. Also placement of this line in
the source is given to help you finding this error, for example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">flat assembler  version 1.70 (16384 kilobytes memory)
example.asm [3]:
        mob     ax,1
error: illegal instruction.
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
It means that in the third line of the <code>example.asm</code> file compiler has
encountered an unrecognized instruction. When the line that caused error
contains a macroinstruction, also the line in macroinstruction definition
that generated the erroneous instruction is displayed:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">flat assembler  version 1.70 (16384 kilobytes memory)
example.asm [6]:
        stoschar 7
example.asm [3] stoschar [1]:
        mob     al,char
error: illegal instruction.
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
It means that the macroinstruction in the sixth line of the <code>example.asm</code> file
generated an unrecognized instruction with the first line of its definition.
</p>

<h4 id="1.1.4" class="smalltext">1.1.4  Output formats</h4>
<p class="smalltext">
By default, when there is no <code>format</code> directive in source file, flat
assembler simply puts generated instruction codes into output, creating this
way flat binary file. By default it generates 16-bit code, but you can always
turn it into the 16-bit or 32-bit mode by using <code>use16</code> or <code>use32</code> directive.
Some of the output formats switch into 32-bit mode, when selected - more
information about formats which you can choose can be found in <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#2.4">2.4</a>.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
All output code is always in the order in which it was entered into the
source file.
</p>

<h3 id="1.2" class="mediumtext">1.2  Assembly syntax</h3>
<p class="smalltext">
The information provided below is intended mainly for the assembler
programmers that have been using some other assembly compilers before.
If you are beginner, you should look for the assembly programming tutorials.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Flat assembler by default uses the Intel syntax for the assembly
instructions, although you can customize it using the preprocessor
capabilities (macroinstructions and symbolic constants). It also has its own
set of the directives - the instructions for compiler.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
All symbols defined inside the sources are case-sensitive.
</p>

<h4 id="1.2.1" class="smalltext">1.2.1  Instruction syntax</h4>
<p class="smalltext">
Instructions in assembly language are separated by line breaks, and one
instruction is expected to fill the one line of text. If a line contains
a semicolon, except for the semicolons inside the quoted strings, the rest of
this line is the comment and compiler ignores it. If a line ends with <code>\</code>
character (eventually the semicolon and comment may follow it), the next line
is attached at this point.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Each line in source is the sequence of items, which may be one of the three
types. One type are the symbol characters, which are the special characters
that are individual items even when are not spaced from the other ones.
Any of the <code>+-/*=&lt;&gt;()[]{}:,|&amp;~#`</code> is the symbol character. The sequence of
other characters, separated from other items with either blank spaces or
symbol characters, is a symbol. If the first character of symbol is either a
single or double quote, it integrates any sequence of characters following
it, even the special ones, into a quoted string, which should end with the same
character, with which it began (the single or double quote) - however if there
are two such characters in a row (without any other character between them),
they are integrated into quoted string as just one of them and the quoted
string continues then. The symbols other than symbol characters and quoted
strings can be used as names, so are also called the name symbols.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Every instruction consists of the mnemonic and the various number of
operands, separated with commas. The operand can be register, immediate value
or a data addressed in memory, it can also be preceded by size operator to
define or override its size (table <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#_1.1">1.1</a>). Names of available registers you can
find in table <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#_1.2">1.2</a>, their sizes cannot be overridden. Immediate value can be
specified by any numerical expression.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
When operand is a data in memory, the address of that data (also any
numerical expression, but it may contain registers) should be enclosed in
square brackets or preceded by <code>ptr</code> operator. For example instruction
<code>mov eax,3</code> will put the immediate value 3 into the EAX register, instruction
<code>mov eax,[7]</code> will put the 32-bit value from the address 7 into EAX and the
instruction <code>mov byte [7],3</code> will put the immediate value 3 into the byte at
address 7, it can also be written as <code>mov byte ptr 7,3</code>.
To specify which segment register should be used for addressing, segment register name followed
by a colon should be put just before the address value (inside the square
brackets or after the <code>ptr</code> operator).

<h4 id="1.2.2" class="smalltext">1.2.2  Data definitions</h4>
<p class="smalltext">
To define data or reserve a space for it, use one of the directives listed in
table <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#_1.3">1.3</a>. The data definition directive should be followed by one or more of
numerical expressions, separated with commas. These expressions define the
values for data cells of size depending on which directive is used. For
example <code>db 1,2,3</code> will define the three bytes of values 1, 2 and 3
respectively.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>db</code> and <code>du</code> directives also accept the quoted string values of any
length, which will be converted into chain of bytes when <code>db</code> is used and into
chain of words with zeroed high byte when <code>du</code> is used.
For example <code>db 'abc'</code> will define the three bytes of values 61, 62 and 63.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>dp</code> directive and its synonym <code>df</code> accept the values consisting of two
numerical expressions separated with colon, the first value will become the
high word and the second value will become the low double word of the far
pointer value. Also <code>dd</code> accepts such pointers consisting of two word values
separated with colon, and <code>dt</code> accepts the word and quad word value separated
with colon, the quad word is stored first. The <code>dt</code> directive with single
expression as parameter accepts only floating point values and creates data in
FPU double extended precision format.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Any of the above directive allows the usage of special <code>dup</code> operator to
make multiple copies of given values. The count of duplicates should precede
this operator and the value to duplicate should follow - it can even be the
chain of values separated with commas, but such set of values needs to be
enclosed with parenthesis, like <code>db&nbsp;5&nbsp;dup&nbsp;(1,2)</code>, which defines five copies
of the given two byte sequence.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>file</code> is a special directive and its syntax is different. This
directive includes a chain of bytes from file and it should be followed by the
quoted file name, then optionally numerical expression specifying offset in
file preceded by the colon, then - also optionally - comma and numerical
expression specifying count of bytes to include (if no count is specified, all
data up to the end of file is included). For example <code>file&nbsp;'data.bin'</code> will
include the whole file as binary data and <code>file&nbsp;'data.bin':10h,4</code> will include
only four bytes starting at offset 10h.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The data reservation directive should be followed by only one numerical
expression, and this value defines how many cells of the specified size should
be reserved. All data definition directives also accept the <code>?</code> value, which
means that this cell should not be initialized to any value and the effect is
the same as by using the data reservation directive. The uninitialized data
may not be included in the output file, so its values should be always
considered unknown.

<h4 id="1.2.3" class="smalltext">1.2.3  Constants and labels</h4>
<p class="smalltext">
In the numerical expressions you can also use constants or labels instead of
numbers. To define the constant or label you should use the specific
directives. Each label can be defined only once and it is accessible from the
any place of source (even before it was defined). Constant can be redefined
many times, but in this case it is accessible only after it was defined, and
is always equal to the value from last definition before the place where it's
used. When a constant is defined only once in source, it is - like the label -
accessible from anywhere.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The definition of constant consists of name of the constant followed by the
<code>=</code> character and numerical expression, which after calculation will become
the value of constant. This value is always calculated at the time the
constant is defined. For example you can define <code>count</code> constant by using the
directive <code>count = 17</code> and then use it in the assembly instructions, like
<code>mov cx,count</code> - which will become <code>mov cx,17</code> during the compilation process.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
There are different ways to define labels. The simplest is to follow the
name of label by the colon, this directive can even be followed by the other
instruction in the same line. It defines the label whose value is equal to
offset of the point where it's defined. This method is usually used to label
the places in code. The other way is to follow the name of label (without a
colon) by some data directive. It defines the label with value equal to
offset of the beginning of defined data, and remembered as a label for data
with cell size as specified for that data directive in table <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#_1.3">1.3</a>.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The label can be treated as constant of value equal to offset of labeled
code or data. For example when you define data using the labeled directive
<code>char db 224</code>, to put the offset of this data into BX register you should use
<code>mov bx,char</code> instruction, and to put the value of byte addressed by <code>char</code>
label to DL register, you should use <code>mov dl,[char]</code> (or <code>mov dl,ptr char</code>).
But when you try to assemble <code>mov ax,[char]</code>, it will cause an error, because
fasm compares the sizes of operands, which should be equal. You can force
assembling that instruction by using size override: <code>mov ax,word [char]</code>,
but remember that this instruction will read the two bytes beginning at <code>char</code>
address, while it was defined as a one byte.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The last and the most flexible way to define labels is to use <code>label</code>
directive. This directive should be followed by the name of label, then
optionally size operator (it can be preceded by a colon) and then - also
optionally <code>at</code> operator and the numerical expression defining the address at
which this label should be defined. For example <code>label wchar word at char</code>
will define a new label for the 16-bit data at the address of <code>char</code>. Now the
instruction <code>mov ax,[wchar]</code> will be after compilation the same as
<code>mov ax,word [char]</code>. If no address is specified, <code>label</code> directive defines
the label at current offset. Thus <code>mov [wchar],57568</code> will copy two bytes
while <code>mov [char],224</code> will copy one byte to the same address.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The label whose name begins with dot is treated as local label, and its name
is attached to the name of last global label (with name beginning with
anything but dot) to make the full name of this label. So you can use the
short name (beginning with dot) of this label anywhere before the next global
label is defined, and in the other places you have to use the full name. Label
beginning with two dots are the exception - they are like global, but they
don't become the new prefix for local labels.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>@@</code> name means anonymous label, you can have defined many of them in
the source. Symbol <code>@b</code> (or equivalent <code>@r</code>) references the nearest preceding
anonymous label, symbol <code>@f</code> references the nearest following anonymous label.
These special symbol are case-insensitive.
</p>

<h4 id="1.2.4" class="smalltext">1.2.4  Numerical expressions</h4>
<p class="smalltext">
In the above examples all the numerical expressions were the simple numbers,
constants or labels. But they can be more complex, by using the arithmetical
or logical operators for calculations at compile time. All these operators
with their priority values are listed in table <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#_1.4">1.4</a>.
The operations with higher priority value will be calculated first, you can
of course change this behavior by putting some parts of expression into
parenthesis. The <code>+</code>,  <code>-</code>,  <code>*</code> and <code>/</code> are standard arithmetical operations,
<code>mod</code> calculates the remainder from division. The <code>and</code>,  <code>or</code>,        <code>xor</code>,  <code>shl</code>,
<code>shr</code>, <code>bsf</code>, <code>bsr</code> and <code>not</code> perform the same bit-logical operations as assembly instructions
of those names.
The <code>rva</code> and <code>plt</code> are special unary operators that perform conversions
between different kinds of addresses, they can be used only with few of the
output formats and their meaning may vary (see <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#2.4">2.4</a>).
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The artithmetical and bit-logical calculations are usually processed as if they
operated on infinite precision 2-adic numbers, and assembler signalizes an
overflow error if because of its limitations it is not table to perform the
required calculation, or if the result is too large number to fit in either
signed or unsigned range for the destination unit size.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The numbers in the expression are by default treated as a decimal, binary
numbers should have the <code>b</code> letter attached at the end, octal number should
end with <code>o</code> letter, hexadecimal numbers should begin with <code>0x</code> characters
(like in C language) or with the <code>$</code> character (like in Pascal language) or
they should end with <code>h</code> letter. Also quoted string, when encountered in
expression, will be converted into number - the first character will become
the least significant byte of number.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The numerical expression used as an address value can also contain any of
general registers used for addressing, they can be added and multiplied by
appropriate values, as it is allowed for the x86 architecture instructions.
The numerical calculations inside address definition by default operate with
target size assumed to be the same as the current bitness of code, even if
generated instruction encoding will use a different size.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
There are also some special symbols that can be used inside the numerical
expression. First is <code>$</code>, which is always equal to the value of current
offset, while <code>$$</code> is equal to base address of current addressing space.
The other one is <code>%</code>,  which is the number of current repeat in parts of code
that are repeated using some special directives (see <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#2.2">2.2</a>) and zero anywhere else.
There's also <code>%t</code> symbol, which is always equal to the current time stamp.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Any numerical expression can also consist of single floating point value
(flat assembler does not allow any floating point operations at compilation
time) in the scientific notation, they can end with the <code>f</code> letter to be
recognized, otherwise they should contain at least one of the <code>.</code> or <code>E</code>
characters. So <code>1.0</code>,  <code>1E0</code> and <code>1f</code> define the same floating point value,
while simple <code>1</code> defines an integer value.

<h4 id="1.2.5" class="smalltext">1.2.5  Jumps and calls</h4>
<p class="smalltext">
The operand of any jump or call instruction can be preceded not only by the
size operator, but also by one of the operators specifying type of the jump:
<code>short</code>, <code>near</code> of <code>far</code>. For example, when assembler is in 16-bit mode,
instruction <code>jmp&nbsp;dword&nbsp;[0]</code> will become the far jump and when assembler is
in 32-bit mode, it will become the near jump. To force this instruction to be
treated differently, use the <code>jmp&nbsp;near&nbsp;dword&nbsp;[0]</code> or <code>jmp&nbsp;far&nbsp;dword&nbsp;[0]</code> form.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
When operand of near jump is the immediate value, assembler will generate
the shortest variant of this jump instruction if possible (but will not create
32-bit instruction in 16-bit mode nor 16-bit instruction in 32-bit mode,
unless there is a size operator stating it). By specifying the jump type
you can force it to always generate long variant (for example <code>jmp&nbsp;near&nbsp;0</code>)
or to always generate short variant and terminate with an error when it's
impossible (for example <code>jmp&nbsp;short&nbsp;0</code>).
</p>

<h4 id="1.2.6" class="smalltext">1.2.6  Size settings</h4>
<p class="smalltext">
When instruction uses some memory addressing, by default the smallest form of
instruction is generated by using the short displacement if only address
value fits in the range. This can be overridden using the <code>word</code>
or <code>dword</code>
operator before the address inside the square brackets (or after the <code>ptr</code>
operator), which forces the long displacement of appropriate size to be made.
In case when address is not relative to any registers, those operators allow
also to choose the appropriate mode of absolute addressing.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Instructions <code>adc</code>, <code>add</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>cmp</code>,
<code>or</code>, <code>sbb</code>, <code>sub</code> and <code>xor</code>
with first operand being 16-bit or 32-bit are by default generated in shortened
8-bit form when the second operand is immediate value fitting in the range
for signed 8-bit values. It also can be overridden by putting the <code>word</code> or
<code>dword</code> operator before the immediate value.
The similar rules applies to the <code>imul</code> instruction with the last operand being immediate value.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Immediate value as an operand for <code>push</code> instruction without a size operator
is by default treated as a word value if assembler is in 16-bit mode and as a
double word value if assembler is in 32-bit mode, shorter 8-bit form of this
instruction is used if possible, <code>word</code> or <code>dword</code> size operator forces the
<code>push</code> instruction to be generated in longer form for specified size. <code>pushw</code>
and <code>pushd</code> mnemonics force assembler to generate 16-bit or 32-bit code
without forcing it to use the longer form of instruction.

<h3 id="2.1" class="mediumtext">2.1  The x86 architecture instructions</h3>

<p class="smalltext">
In this section you can find both the information about the syntax and
purpose the assembly language instructions. If you need more technical
information, look for the Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Assembly instructions consist of the mnemonic (instruction's name) and from
zero to three operands. If there are two or more operands, usually first is
the destination operand and second is the source operand. Each operand can be
register, memory or immediate value (see <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#1.2">1.2</a> for details about syntax of
operands). After the description of each instruction there are examples
of different combinations of operands, if the instruction has any.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Some instructions act as prefixes and can be followed by other instruction
in the same line, and there can be more than one prefix in a line. Each name
of the segment register is also a mnemonic of instruction prefix, altough it
is recommended to use segment overrides inside the square brackets instead of
these prefixes.
</p>

<h4 id="2.1.1" class="smalltext">2.1.1  Data movement instructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>mov</code> transfers a byte, word or double word from the source operand to the
destination operand. It can transfer data between general registers, from
the general register to memory, or from memory to general register, but it
cannot move from memory to memory. It can also transfer an immediate value to
general register or memory, segment register to general register or memory,
general register or memory to segment register, control or debug register to
general register and general register to control or debug register. The <code>mov</code>
can be assembled only if the size of source operand and size of destination
operand are the same. Below are the examples for each of the allowed
combinations:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    mov bx,ax       ; general register to general register
    mov [char],al   ; general register to memory
    mov bl,[char]   ; memory to general register
    mov dl,32       ; immediate value to general register
    mov [char],32   ; immediate value to memory
    mov ax,ds       ; segment register to general register
    mov [bx],ds     ; segment register to memory
    mov ds,ax       ; general register to segment register
    mov ds,[bx]     ; memory to segment register
    mov eax,cr0     ; control register to general register
    mov cr3,ebx     ; general register to control register
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>xchg</code> swaps the contents of two operands. It can swap two byte operands,
two word operands or two double word operands. Order of operands is not
important. The operands may be two general registers, or general register
with memory. For example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    xchg ax,bx      ; swap two general registers
    xchg al,[char]  ; swap register with memory
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>push</code> decrements the stack frame pointer (ESP register), then transfers
the operand to the top of stack indicated by ESP. The operand can be memory,
general register, segment register or immediate value of word or double word
size. If operand is an immediate value and no size is specified, it is by
default treated as a word value if assembler is in 16-bit mode and as a double
word value if assembler is in 32-bit mode. <code>pushw</code> and <code>pushd</code> mnemonics are
variants of this instruction that store the values of word or double word size
respectively. If more operands follow in the same line (separated only with
spaces, not commas), compiler will assemble chain of the <code>push</code> instructions
with these operands. The examples are with single operands:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    push ax         ; store general register
    push es         ; store segment register
    pushw [bx]      ; store memory
    push 1000h      ; store immediate value
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>pusha</code> saves the contents of the eight general register on the stack.
This instruction has no operands. There are two version of this instruction,
one 16-bit and one 32-bit, assembler automatically generates the appropriate
version for current mode, but it can be overridden by using <code>pushaw</code> or
<code>pushad</code> mnemonic to always get the 16-bit or 32-bit version. The 16-bit
version of this instruction pushes general registers on the stack in the
following order: AX, CX, DX, BX, the initial value of SP before AX was pushed,
BP, SI and DI. The 32-bit version pushes equivalent 32-bit general registers
in the same order.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>pop</code> transfers the word or double word at the current top of stack to the
destination operand, and then increments ESP to point to the new top of stack.
The operand can be memory, general register or segment register. <code>popw</code> and
<code>popd</code> mnemonics are variants of this instruction for restoring the values of
word or double word size respectively. If more operands separated with spaces
follow in the same line, compiler will assemble chain of the <code>pop</code>
instructions with these operands.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    pop bx          ; restore general register
    pop ds          ; restore segment register
    popw [si]       ; restore memory
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>popa</code> restores the registers saved on the stack by <code>pusha</code> instruction,
except for the saved value of SP (or ESP), which is ignored. This instruction
has no operands. To force assembling 16-bit or 32-bit version of this
instruction use <code>popaw</code> or <code>popad</code> mnemonic.
</p>

<h4 id="2.1.2" class="smalltext">2.1.2  Type conversion instructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
The type conversion instructions convert bytes into words, words into double
words, and double words into quad words. These conversions can be done using
the sign extension or zero extension. The sign extension fills the extra bits
of the larger item with the value of the sign bit of the smaller item, the
zero extension simply fills them with zeros.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>cwd</code> and <code>cdq</code> double the size of value AX or EAX register respectively
and store the extra bits into the DX or EDX register. The conversion is done
using the sign extension. These instructions have no operands.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>cbw</code> extends the sign of the byte in AL throughout AX, and <code>cwde</code> extends
the sign of the word in AX throughout EAX. These instructions also have no
operands.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>movsx</code> converts a byte to word or double word and a word to double word
using the sign extension. <code>movzx</code> does the same, but it uses the zero
extension. The source operand can be general register or memory, while the
destination operand must be a general register. For example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    movsx ax,al         ; byte register to word register
    movsx edx,dl        ; byte register to double word register
    movsx eax,ax        ; word register to double word register
    movsx ax,byte [bx]  ; byte memory to word register
    movsx edx,byte [bx] ; byte memory to double word register
    movsx eax,word [bx] ; word memory to double word register
</pre>

<h4 id="2.1.3" class="smalltext">2.1.3  Binary arithmetic instructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>add</code> replaces the destination operand with the sum of the source and
destination operands and sets CF if overflow has occurred. The operands may
be bytes, words or double words. The destination operand can be general
register or memory, the source operand can be general register or immediate
value, it can also be memory if the destination operand is register.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    add ax,bx       ; add register to register
    add ax,[si]     ; add memory to register
    add [di],al     ; add register to memory
    add al,48       ; add immediate value to register
    add [char],48   ; add immediate value to memory
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>adc</code> sums the operands, adds one if CF is set, and replaces the destination
operand with the result. Rules for the operands are the same as for the <code>add</code>
instruction. An <code>add</code> followed by multiple <code>adc</code> instructions can be used to
add numbers longer than 32 bits.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>inc</code> adds one to the operand, it does not affect CF. The operand can be
general register or memory, and the size of the operand can be byte, word or double word.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    inc ax          ; increment register by one
    inc byte [bx]   ; increment memory by one
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>sub</code> subtracts the source operand from the destination operand and replaces
the destination operand with the result. If a borrow is required, the CF is
set. Rules for the operands are the same as for the <code>add</code> instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>sbb</code> subtracts the source operand from the destination operand, subtracts
one if CF is set, and stores the result to the destination operand. Rules for
the operands are the same as for the <code>add</code> instruction. A <code>sub</code> followed by
multiple <code>sbb</code> instructions may be used to subtract numbers longer than 32
bits.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>dec</code> subtracts one from the operand, it does not affect CF. Rules for the
operand are the same as for the <code>inc</code> instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>cmp</code> subtracts the source operand from the destination operand. It updates
the flags as the <code>sub</code> instruction, but does not alter the source and
destination operands. Rules for the operands are the same as for the <code>sub</code>
instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>neg</code> subtracts a signed integer operand from zero. The effect of this
instructon is to reverse the sign of the operand from positive to negative or
from negative to positive. Rules for the operand are the same as for the <code>inc</code>
instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>xadd</code> exchanges the destination operand with the source operand, then loads
the sum of the two values into the destination operand. The destination operand
may be a general register or memory, the source operand must be a general register.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
All the above binary arithmetic instructions update SF, ZF, PF and OF flags.
SF is always set to the same value as the result's sign bit, ZF is set when
all the bits of result are zero, PF is set when low order eight bits of result
contain an even number of set bits, OF is set if result is too large for a
positive number or too small for a negative number (excluding sign bit) to fit
in destination operand.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>mul</code> performs an unsigned multiplication of the operand and the
accumulator. If the operand is a byte, the processor multiplies it by the
contents of AL and returns the 16-bit result to AH and AL. If the operand is a
word, the processor multiplies it by the contents of AX and returns the 32-bit
result to DX and AX. If the operand is a double word, the processor multiplies
it by the contents of EAX and returns the 64-bit result in EDX and EAX. <code>mul</code>
sets CF and OF when the upper half of the result is nonzero, otherwise they
are cleared. Rules for the operand are the same as for the <code>inc</code> instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>imul</code> performs a signed multiplication operation. This instruction has
three variations. First has one operand and behaves in the same way as the
<code>mul</code> instruction. Second has two operands, in this case destination operand
is multiplied by the source operand and the result replaces the destination
operand. Destination operand must be a general register, it can be word or
double word, source operand can be general register, memory or immediate
value. Third form has three operands, the destination operand must be a general register,
word or double word in size, source operand can be general register or memory, and
third operand must be an immediate value. The source operand is multiplied by
the immediate value and the result is stored in the destination register.
All the three forms calculate the product to twice the size of operands and
set CF and OF when the upper half of the result is nonzero, but second and
third form truncate the product to the size of operands. So second and third
forms can be also used for unsigned operands because, whether the operands
are signed or unsigned, the lower half of the product is the same.
Below are the examples for all three forms:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    imul bl         ; accumulator by register
    imul word [si]  ; accumulator by memory
    imul bx,cx      ; register by register
    imul bx,[si]    ; register by memory
    imul bx,10      ; register by immediate value
    imul ax,bx,10   ; register by immediate value to register
    imul ax,[si],10 ; memory by immediate value to register
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>div</code> performs an unsigned division of the accumulator by the operand.
The dividend (the accumulator) is twice the size of the divisor (the operand),
the quotient and remainder have the same size as the divisor. If divisor is
byte, the dividend is taken from AX register, the quotient is stored in AL and
the remainder is stored in AH. If divisor is word, the upper half of dividend
is taken from DX, the lower half of dividend is taken from AX, the quotient is
stored in AX and the remainder is stored in DX. If divisor is double word,
the upper half of dividend is taken from EDX, the lower half of dividend is
taken from EAX, the quotient is stored in EAX and the remainder is stored in
EDX. Rules for the operand are the same as for the <code>mul</code> instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>idiv</code> performs a signed division of the accumulator by the operand.
It uses the same registers as the <code>div</code> instruction, and the rules for
the operand are the same.
</p>

<h4 id="2.1.4" class="smalltext">2.1.4  Decimal arithmetic instructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
Decimal arithmetic is performed by combining the binary arithmetic
instructions (already described in the prior section) with the decimal
arithmetic instructions. The decimal arithmetic instructions are used to
adjust the results of a previous binary arithmetic operation to produce a
valid packed or unpacked decimal result, or to adjust the inputs to a
subsequent binary arithmetic operation so the operation will produce a valid
packed or unpacked decimal result.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>daa</code> adjusts the result of adding two valid packed decimal operands in
AL. <code>daa</code> must always follow the addition of two pairs of packed decimal
numbers (one digit in each half-byte) to obtain a pair of valid packed
decimal digits as results. The carry flag is set if carry was needed.
This instruction has no operands.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>das</code> adjusts the result of subtracting two valid packed decimal operands
in AL. <code>das</code> must always follow the subtraction of one pair of packed decimal
numbers (one digit in each half-byte) from another to obtain a pair of valid
packed decimal digits as results. The carry flag is set if a borrow was
needed. This instruction has no operands.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>aaa</code> changes the contents of register AL to a valid unpacked decimal
number, and zeroes the top four bits. <code>aaa</code> must always follow the addition
of two unpacked decimal operands in AL. The carry flag is set and AH is
incremented if a carry is necessary. This instruction has no operands.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>aas</code> changes the contents of register AL to a valid unpacked decimal
number, and zeroes the top four bits. <code>aas</code> must always follow the
subtraction of one unpacked decimal operand from another in AL. The carry flag
is set and AH decremented if a borrow is necessary. This instruction has no
operands.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>aam</code> corrects the result of a multiplication of two valid unpacked decimal
numbers. <code>aam</code> must always follow the multiplication of two decimal numbers
to produce a valid decimal result. The high order digit is left in AH, the
low order digit in AL. The generalized version of this instruction allows
adjustment of the contents of the AX to create two unpacked digits of any
number base. The standard version of this instruction has no operands, the
generalized version has one operand - an immediate value specifying the
number base for the created digits.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>aad</code> modifies the numerator in AH and AL to prepare for the division of two
valid unpacked decimal operands so that the quotient produced by the division
will be a valid unpacked decimal number. AH should contain the high order
digit and AL the low order digit. This instruction adjusts the value and
places the result in AL, while AH will contain zero. The generalized version
of this instruction allows adjustment of two unpacked digits of any number
base. Rules for the operand are the same as for the <code>aam</code> instruction.
</p>

<h4 id="2.1.5" class="smalltext">2.1.5  Logical instructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>not</code> inverts the bits in the specified operand to form a one's
complement of the operand. It has no effect on the flags. Rules for the
operand are the same as for the <code>inc</code> instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>xor</code> instructions perform the standard
logical operations. They update the SF, ZF and PF flags. Rules for the
operands are the same as for the <code>add</code> instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>bt</code>, <code>bts</code>, <code>btr</code> and <code>btc</code> instructions operate on a single bit which can
be in memory or in a general register. The location of the bit is specified
as an offset from the low order end of the operand. The value of the offset
is the taken from the second operand, it either may be an immediate byte or
a general register. These instructions first assign the value of the selected
bit to CF. <code>bt</code> instruction does nothing more, <code>bts</code> sets the selected bit to
1, <code>btr</code> resets the selected bit to 0, <code>btc</code> changes the bit to its
complement. The first operand can be word or double word.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    bt  ax,15        ; test bit in register
    bts word [bx],15 ; test and set bit in memory
    btr ax,cx        ; test and reset bit in register
    btc word [bx],cx ; test and complement bit in memory
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>bsf</code> and <code>bsr</code> instructions scan a word or double word for first set bit
and store the index of this bit into destination operand, which must be
general register. The bit string being scanned is specified by source operand,
it may be either general register or memory. The ZF flag is set if the entire
string is zero (no set bits are found); otherwise it is cleared. If no set bit
is found, the value of the destination register is undefined. <code>bsf</code> scans from
low order to high order (starting from bit index zero). <code>bsr</code> scans from high
order to low order (starting from bit index 15 of a word or index 31 of a
double word).
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    bsf ax,bx        ; scan register forward
    bsr ax,[si]      ; scan memory reverse
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>shl</code> shifts the destination operand left by the number of bits specified
in the second operand. The destination operand can be byte, word, or double
word general register or memory. The second operand can be an immediate value
or the CL register. The processor shifts zeros in from the right (low order)
side of the operand as bits exit from the left side. The last bit that exited
is stored in CF. <code>sal</code> is a synonym for <code>shl</code>.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    shl al,1         ; shift register left by one bit
    shl byte [bx],1  ; shift memory left by one bit
    shl ax,cl        ; shift register left by count from cl
    shl word [bx],cl ; shift memory left by count from cl
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>shr</code> and <code>sar</code> shift the destination operand right by the number of bits
specified in the second operand. Rules for operands are the same as for the
<code>shl</code> instruction. <code>shr</code> shifts zeros in from the left side of the operand as
bits exit from the right side. The last bit that exited is stored in CF.
<code>sar</code> preserves the sign of the operand by shifting in zeros on the left side
if the value is positive or by shifting in ones if the value is negative.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>shld</code> shifts bits of the destination operand to the left by the number
of bits specified in third operand, while shifting high order bits from the
source operand into the destination operand on the right. The source operand
remains unmodified. The destination operand can be a word or double word
general register or memory, the source operand must be a general register,
third operand can be an immediate value or the CL register.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    shld ax,bx,1     ; shift register left by one bit
    shld [di],bx,1   ; shift memory left by one bit
    shld ax,bx,cl    ; shift register left by count from cl
    shld [di],bx,cl  ; shift memory left by count from cl
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>shrd</code> shifts bits of the destination operand to the right, while shifting
low order bits from the source operand into the destination operand on the
left. The source operand remains unmodified. Rules for operands are the same
as for the <code>shld</code> instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>rol</code> and <code>rcl</code> rotate the byte, word or double word destination operand
left by the number of bits specified in the second operand. For each rotation
specified, the high order bit that exits from the left of the operand returns
at the right to become the new low order bit. <code>rcl</code> additionally puts in CF
each high order bit that exits from the left side of the operand before it
returns to the operand as the low order bit on the next rotation cycle. Rules
for operands are the same as for the <code>shl</code> instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>ror</code> and <code>rcr</code> rotate the byte, word or double word destination operand
right by the number of bits specified in the second operand. For each rotation
specified, the low order bit that exits from the right of the operand returns
at the left to become the new high order bit. <code>rcr</code> additionally puts in CF
each low order bit that exits from the right side of the operand before it
returns to the operand as the high order bit on the next rotation cycle.
Rules for operands are the same as for the <code>shl</code> instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>test</code> performs the same action as the <code>and</code> instruction, but it does not
alter the destination operand, only updates flags. Rules for the operands are
the same as for the <code>and</code> instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>bswap</code> reverses the byte order of a 32-bit general register: bits 0 through
7 are swapped with bits 24 through 31, and bits 8 through 15 are swapped with
bits 16 through 23. This instruction is provided for converting little-endian
values to big-endian format and vice versa.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    bswap edx        ; swap bytes in register
</pre>

<h4 id="2.1.6" class="smalltext">2.1.6  Control transfer instructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>jmp</code> unconditionally transfers control to the target location. The
destination address can be specified directly within the instruction or
indirectly through a register or memory, the acceptable size of this address
depends on whether the jump is near or far (it can be specified by preceding
the operand with <code>near</code> or <code>far</code> operator) and whether the instruction is
16-bit or 32-bit. Operand for near jump should be <code>word</code> size for 16-bit
instruction or the <code>dword</code> size for 32-bit instruction. Operand for far jump
should be <code>dword</code> size for 16-bit instruction or <code>pword</code> size for 32-bit
instruction. A direct <code>jmp</code> instruction includes the destination address as
part of the instruction (and can be preceded by <code>short</code>, <code>near</code> or <code>far</code>
operator), the operand specifying address should be the numerical expression
for near or short jump, or two numerical expressions separated with colon for
far jump, the first specifies selector of segment, the second is the offset
within segment. The <code>pword</code> operator can be used to force the 32-bit far call,
and <code>dword</code> to force the 16-bit far call. An indirect <code>jmp</code> instruction
obtains the destination address indirectly through a register or a pointer
variable, the operand should be general register or memory. See also 1.2.5 for
some more details.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    jmp 100h         ; direct near jump
    jmp 0FFFFh:0     ; direct far jump
    jmp ax           ; indirect near jump
    jmp pword [ebx]  ; indirect far jump
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>call</code> transfers control to the procedure, saving on the stack the address
of the instruction following the <code>call</code> for later use by a <code>ret</code> (return)
instruction. Rules for the operands are the same as for the <code>jmp</code> instruction,
but the <code>call</code> has no short variant of direct instruction and thus it not
optimized.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>ret</code>, <code>retn</code> and <code>retf</code> instructions terminate the execution of a procedure
and transfers control back to the program that originally invoked the
procedure using the address that was stored on the stack by the <code>call</code>
instruction. <code>ret</code> is the equivalent for <code>retn</code>, which returns from the
procedure that was executed using the near call, while <code>retf</code> returns from
the procedure that was executed using the far call. These instructions default
to the size of address appropriate for the current code setting, but the size
of address can be forced to 16-bit by using the <code>retw</code>, <code>retnw</code> and <code>retfw</code>
mnemonics, and to 32-bit by using the <code>retd</code>, <code>retnd</code> and <code>retfd</code> mnemonics.
All these instructions may optionally specify an immediate operand, by adding
this constant to the stack pointer, they effectively remove any arguments that
the calling program pushed on the stack before the execution of the <code>call</code>
instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>iret</code> returns control to an interrupted procedure. It differs from <code>ret</code> in
that it also pops the flags from the stack into the flags register. The flags
are stored on the stack by the interrupt mechanism. It defaults to the size of
return address appropriate for the current code setting, but it can be forced
to use 16-bit or 32-bit address by using the <code>iretw</code> or <code>iretd</code> mnemonic.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The conditional transfer instructions are jumps that may or may not transfer
control, depending on the state of the CPU flags when the instruction
executes. The mnemonics for conditional jumps may be obtained by attaching
the condition mnemonic (see table <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#_2.1">2.1</a>) to the <code>j</code> mnemonic,
for example <code>jc</code> instruction will transfer the control when the CF flag is
set. The conditional jumps can be short or near, and direct only, and can be optimized
(see <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#1.2.5">1.2.5</a>), the operand should be an immediate value specifying target
address.

The <code>loop</code> instructions are conditional jumps that use a value placed in
CX (or ECX) to specify the number of repetitions of a software loop. All
<code>loop</code> instructions automatically decrement CX (or ECX) and terminate the
loop (don't transfer the control) when CX (or ECX) is zero. It uses CX or ECX
whether the current code setting is 16-bit or 32-bit, but it can be forced to
us CX with the <code>loopw</code> mnemonic or to use ECX with the <code>loopd</code> mnemonic.
<code>loope</code> and <code>loopz</code> are the synonyms for the same instruction, which acts as
the standard <code>loop</code>, but also terminates the loop when ZF flag is set.
<code>loopew</code> and <code>loopzw</code> mnemonics force them to use CX register while <code>looped</code>
and <code>loopzd</code> force them to use ECX register. <code>loopne</code> and <code>loopnz</code> are the
synonyms for the same instructions, which acts as the standard <code>loop</code>, but
also terminate the loop when ZF flag is not set. <code>loopnew</code> and <code>loopnzw</code>
mnemonics force them to use CX register while <code>loopned</code> and <code>loopnzd</code> force
them to use ECX register. Every <code>loop</code> instruction needs an operand being an
immediate value specifying target address, it can be only short jump (in the
range of 128 bytes back and 127 bytes forward from the address of instruction
following the <code>loop</code> instruction).
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>jcxz</code> branches to the label specified in the instruction if it finds a
value of zero in CX, <code>jecxz</code> does the same, but checks the value of ECX

instruction.

<code>int</code> activates the interrupt service routine that corresponds to the
number specified as an operand to the instruction, the number should be in
range from 0 to 255. The interrupt service routine terminates with an <code>iret</code>
instruction that returns control to the instruction that follows <code>int</code>.
<code>int3</code> mnemonic codes the short (one byte) trap that invokes the interrupt 3.
<code>into</code> instruction invokes the interrupt 4 if the OF flag is set.

<code>bound</code> verifies that the signed value contained in the specified register
lies within specified limits. An interrupt 5 occurs if the value contained in

<p class="smalltext">
The string operations operate on one element of a string. A string element
may be a byte, a word, or a double word. The string elements are addressed by
SI and DI (or ESI and EDI) registers. After every string operation SI and/or
DI (or ESI and/or EDI) are automatically updated to point to the next element
of the string. If DF (direction flag) is zero, the index registers are
incremented, if DF is one, they are decremented. The amount of the increment
or decrement is 1, 2, or 4 depending on the size of the string element. Every
string operation instruction has short forms which have no operands and use
SI and/or DI when the code type is 16-bit, and ESI and/or EDI when the code
type is 32-bit. SI and ESI by default address data in the segment selected
by DS, DI and EDI always address data in the segment selected by ES. Short
form is obtained by attaching to the mnemonic of string operation letter
specifying the size of string element, it should be <code>b</code> for byte element,
<code>w</code> for word element, and <code>d</code> for double word element. Full form of string
operation needs operands providing the size operator and the memory addresses,
which can be SI or ESI with any segment prefix, DI or EDI always with ES
segment prefix.

The repeat prefixes <code>rep</code>, <code>repe</code>/<code>repz</code>, and <code>repne</code>/<code>repnz</code> specify
repeated string operation. When a string operation instruction has a repeat
prefix, the operation is executed repeatedly, each time using a different
element of the string. The repetition terminates when one of the conditions
specified by the prefix is satisfied. All three prefixes automatically
decrease CX or ECX register (depending whether string operation instruction
uses the 16-bit or 32-bit addressing) after each operation and repeat the
associated operation until CX or ECX is zero. <code>repe</code>/<code>repz</code> and
<code>repne</code>/<code>repnz</code> are used exclusively with the <code>scas</code> and <code>cmps</code> instructions
(described below). When these prefixes are used, repetition of the next
instruction depends on the zero flag (ZF) also, <code>repe</code> and <code>repz</code> terminate
the execution when the ZF is zero, <code>repne</code> and <code>repnz</code> terminate the execution
when the ZF is set.

<code>pause</code> instruction delays the execution of the next instruction an
implementation specific amount of time. It can be used to improve the

<p class="smalltext">
<code>enter</code> creates a stack frame that may be used to implement the scope rules
of block-structured high-level languages. A <code>leave</code> instruction at the end of
a procedure complements an <code>enter</code> at the beginning of the procedure to
simplify stack management and to control access to variables for nested
procedures. The <code>enter</code> instruction includes two parameters. The first
parameter specifies the number of bytes of dynamic storage to be allocated on
the stack for the routine being entered. The second parameter corresponds to
the lexical nesting level of the routine, it can be in range from 0 to 31.
The specified lexical level determines how many sets of stack frame pointers
the CPU copies into the new stack frame from the preceding frame. This list
of stack frame pointers is sometimes called the display. The first word (or
double word when code is 32-bit) of the display is a pointer to the last stack
frame. This pointer enables a <code>leave</code> instruction to reverse the action of the
previous <code>enter</code> instruction by effectively discarding the last stack frame.
After <code>enter</code> creates the new display for a procedure, it allocates the
dynamic storage space for that procedure by decrementing ESP by the number of
bytes specified in the first parameter. To enable a procedure to address its
display, <code>enter</code> leaves BP (or EBP) pointing to the beginning of the new stack
frame. If the lexical level is zero, <code>enter</code> pushes BP (or EBP), copies SP to
BP (or ESP to EBP) and then subtracts the first operand from ESP. For nesting
levels greater than zero, the processor pushes additional frame pointers on
the stack before adjusting the stack pointer.

The FPU (Floating-Point Unit) instructions operate on the floating-point
values in three formats: single precision (32-bit), double precision (64-bit)
and double extended precision (80-bit). The FPU registers form the stack and
each of them holds the double extended precision floating-point value. When
some values are pushed onto the stack or are removed from the top, the FPU
registers are shifted, so ST0 is always the value on the top of FPU stack, ST1
is the first value below the top, etc. The ST0 name has also the synonym ST.

<h4 id="2.1.19" class="smalltext">2.1.19  The x86-64 long mode instructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
The AMD64 and EM64T architectures (we will use the common name x86-64 for them
both) extend the x86 instruction set for the 64-bit processing. While legacy
and compatibility modes use the same set of registers and instructions, the
new long mode extends the x86 operations to 64 bits and introduces several new
registers. You can turn on generating the code for this mode with the <code>use64</code>
directive.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Each of the general purpose registers is extended to 64 bits and the eight
whole new general purpose registers and also eight new SSE registers are added.
See table <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#_2.4">2.4</a> for the summary of new registers (only the ones that was not
listed in table <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#_1.2">1.2</a>). The general purpose registers of smallers sizes are the
low order portions of the larger ones. You can still access the <code>ah</code>, <code>bh</code>,
<code>ch</code> and <code>dh</code> registers in long mode, but you cannot use them in the same
instruction with any of the new registers.

<p class="smalltext">
In general any instruction from x86 architecture, which allowed 16-bit or
32-bit operand sizes, in long mode allows also the 64-bit operands. The 64-bit
registers should be used for addressing in long mode, the 32-bit addressing
is also allowed, but it's not possible to use the addresses based on 16-bit
registers. Below are the samples of new operations possible in long mode on the
example of <code>mov</code> instruction:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    mov rax,r8   ; transfer 64-bit general register
    mov al,[rbx] ; transfer memory addressed by 64-bit register
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The long mode uses also the instruction pointer based addresses, you can
specify it manually with the special RIP register symbol, but such addressing
is also automatically generated by flat assembler, since there is no 64-bit
absolute addressing in long mode. You can still force the assembler to use the
32-bit absolute addressing by putting the <code>dword</code>
size override for address inside the square brackets.
There is also one exception, where the 64-bit absolute addressing is possible,
it's the <code>mov</code> instruction with one of the
operand being accumulator register, and second being the memory operand.
To force the assembler to use the 64-bit absolute addressing there, use the
<code>qword</code> size operator for address inside the square brackets.
When no size operator is applied to address, assembler generates the optimal form
automatically.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    mov [qword 0],rax  ; absolute 64-bit addressing
    mov [dword 0],r15d ; absolute 32-bit addressing
    mov [0],rsi        ; automatic RIP-relative addressing
    mov [rip+3],sil    ; manual RIP-relative addressing
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
Also as the immediate operands for 64-bit operations only the signed 32-bit
values are possible, with the only exception being the <code>mov</code> instruction with
destination operand being 64-bit general purpose register. Trying to force the
64-bit immediate with any other instruction will cause an error.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
If any operation is performed on the 32-bit general registers in long mode,
the upper 32 bits of the 64-bit registers containing them are filled with
zeros. This is unlike the operations on 16-bit or 8-bit portions of those
registers, which preserve the upper bits.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Three new type conversion instructions are available. The <code>cdqe</code> sign extends
the double word in EAX into quad word and stores the result in RAX register.
<code>cqo</code> sign extends the quad word in RAX into double quad word and stores the
extra bits in the RDX register. These instructions have no operands. <code>movsxd</code>
sign extends the double word source operand, being either the 32-bit register
or memory, into 64-bit destination operand, which has to be register.
No analogous instruction is needed for the zero extension, since it is done
automatically by any operations on 32-bit registers, as noted in previous
paragraph. And the <code>movzx</code> and <code>movsx</code> instructions, conforming to the general
rule, can be used with 64-bit destination operand, allowing extension of byte
or word values into quad words.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
All the binary arithmetic and logical instruction are promoted to allow
64-bit operands in long mode. The use of decimal arithmetic instructions in
long mode prohibited.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The stack operations, like <code>push</code> and <code>pop</code> in long mode default to 64-bit
operands and it's not possible to use 32-bit operands with them. The <code>pusha</code>
and <code>popa</code> are disallowed in long mode.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The indirect near jumps and calls in long mode default to 64-bit operands and
it's not possible to use the 32-bit operands with them. On the other hand, the
indirect far jumps and calls allow any operands that were allowed by the x86
architecture and also 80-bit memory operand is allowed (though only EM64T seems
to implement such variant), with the first eight bytes defining the offset and
two last bytes specifying the selector. The direct far jumps and calls are not
allowed in long mode.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The I/O instructions, <code>in</code>, <code>out</code>, <code>ins</code> and <code>outs</code> are the exceptional
instructions that are not extended to accept quad word operands in long mode.
But all other string operations are, and there are new short forms <code>movsq</code>,
<code>cmpsq</code>, <code>scasq</code>, <code>lodsq</code> and <code>stosq</code> introduced for the variants of string
operations for 64-bit string elements. The RSI and RDI registers are used by
default to address the string elements.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>lfs</code>, <code>lgs</code> and <code>lss</code> instructions are extended to accept 80-bit source
memory operand with 64-bit destination register (though only EM64T seems to
implement such variant). The <code>lds</code> and <code>les</code> are disallowed in long mode.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The system instructions like <code>lgdt</code> which required the 48-bit memory operand,
in long mode require the 80-bit memory operand.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>cmpxchg16b</code> is the 64-bit equivalent of <code>cmpxchg8b</code> instruction, it uses
the double quad word memory operand and 64-bit registers to perform the
analoguous operation.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>fxsave64</code> and <code>fxrstor64</code> are new variants of <code>fxsave</code> and <code>fxrstor</code>
instructions, available only in long mode, which use a different format of
storage area in order to store some pointers in full 64-bit size.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>swapgs</code> is the new instruction, which swaps the contents of GS register and
the KernelGSbase model-specific register (MSR address 0C0000102h).
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>syscall</code> and <code>sysret</code> is the pair of new instructions that provide the
functionality similar to <code>sysenter</code> and <code>sysexit</code> in long mode, where the
latter pair is disallowed. The <code>sysexitq</code> and <code>sysretq</code> mnemonics provide the
64-bit versions of <code>sysexit</code> and <code>sysret</code> instructions.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>rdmsrq</code> and <code>wrmsrq</code> mnemonics are the 64-bit variants of the <code>rdmsr</code>

<h4 id="2.1.20" class="smalltext">2.1.20  SSE4 instructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
There are actually three different sets of instructions under the name SSE4.
Intel designed two of them, SSE4.1 and SSE4.2, with latter extending the
former into the full Intel's SSE4 set. On the other hand, the implementation
by AMD includes only a few instructions from this set, but also contains
some additional instructions, that are called the SSE4a set.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The SSE4.1 instructions mostly follow the same rules for operands, as
the basic SSE operations, so they require destination operand to be SSE
register and source operand to be 128-bit memory location or SSE register,
and some operations require a third operand, the 8-bit immediate value.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>pmulld</code> performs a signed multiplication of the packed double words and
stores the low double words of the results in the destination operand.
<code>pmuldq</code> performs a two signed multiplications of the corresponding double
words in the lower quad words of operands, and stores the results as
packed quad words into the destination register. <code>pminsb</code> and <code>pmaxsb</code>
return the minimum or maximum values of packed signed bytes, <code>pminuw</code> and
<code>pmaxuw</code> return the minimum and maximum values of packed unsigned words,
<code>pminud</code>, <code>pmaxud</code>, <code>pminsd</code> and <code>pmaxsd</code> return minimum or maximum values
of packed unsigned or signed words. These instructions complement the
instructions computing packed minimum or maximum introduced by SSE.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>ptest</code> sets the ZF flag to one when the result of bitwise AND of the
both operands is zero, and zeroes the ZF otherwise. It also sets CF flag
to one, when the result of bitwise AND of the destination operand with
the bitwise NOT of the source operand is zero, and zeroes the CF otherwise.
<code>pcmpeqq</code> compares packed quad words for equality, and fills the
corresponding elements of destination operand with either ones or zeros,
depending on the result of comparison.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>packusdw</code> converts packed signed double words from both the source and
destination operand into the unsigned words using saturation, and stores
the eight resulting word values into the destination register.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>phminposuw</code> finds the minimum unsigned word value in source operand
and places it into the lowest word of destination operand, setting the
remaining upper bits of destination to zero.

<p class="smalltext">
<code>roundps</code>, <code>roundss</code>, <code>roundpd</code> and <code>roundsd</code> perform the rounding of
packed or individual floating point value of single or double precision,

<code>dpps</code> calculates dot product of packed single precision floating point
values, that is it multiplies the corresponding pairs of values from source and
destination operand and then sums the products up. The high four bits of the
8-bit immediate third operand control which products are calculated and taken
to the sum, and the low four bits control, into which elements of destination
the resulting dot product is copied (the other elements are filled with zero).
<code>dppd</code> calculates dot product of packed double precision floating point values.
The bits 4 and 5 of third operand control, which products are calculated and
added, and bits 0 and 1 of this value control, which elements in destination
register should get filled with the result. <code>mpsadbw</code> calculates multiple sums
of absolute differences of unsigned bytes. The third operand controls, with
value in bits 0-1, which of the four-byte blocks in source operand is taken to
calculate the absolute differencies, and with value in bit 2, at which of the
two first four-byte block in destination operand start calculating multiple
sums. The sum is calculated from four absolute differencies between the
corresponding unsigned bytes in the source and destination block, and each next
sum is calculated in the same way, but taking the four bytes from destination
at the position one byte after the position of previous block. The four bytes
from the source stay the same each time. This way eight sums of absolute
differencies are calculated and stored as packed word values into the
destination operand. The instructions described in this paragraph follow the
same rules for operands, as <code>roundps</code> instruction.

<code>blendps</code>, <code>blendvps</code>, <code>blendpd</code> and <code>blendvpd</code> conditionally copy the
values from source operand into the destination operand, depending on the bits
of the mask provided by third operand. If a mask bit is set, the corresponding
element of source is copied into the same place in destination, otherwise this
position is destination is left unchanged. The rules for the first two operands
are the same, as for general SSE instructions. <code>blendps</code> and <code>blendpd</code> need
third operand to be 8-bit immediate, and they operate on single or double
precision values, respectively. <code>blendvps</code> and <code>blendvpd</code> require third operand
to be the XMM0 register.

<h4 id="2.1.21" class="smalltext">2.1.21  AVX instructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
The Advanced Vector Extensions introduce instructions that are new variants
of SSE instructions, with new scheme of encoding that allows extended syntax
having a destination operand separate from all the source operands. It also
introduces 256-bit AVX registers, which extend up the old 128-bit SSE
registers. Any AVX instruction that puts some result into SSE register, puts
zero bits into high portion of the AVX register containing it.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The AVX version of SSE instruction has the mnemonic obtained by prepending
SSE instruction name with <code>v</code>. For any SSE arithmetic instruction which had a
destination operand also being used as one of the source values, the AVX
variant has a new syntax with three operands - the destination and two sources.
The destination and first source can be SSE registers, and second source can be
SSE register or memory. If the operation is performed on single pair of values,
the remaining bits of first source SSE register are copied into the the
destination register.

    vmulsd xmm0,xmm7,qword [esi]  ; multiply two 64-bit floats
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
In case of packed operations, each instruction can also operate on the 256-bit
data size when the AVX registers are specified instead of SSE registers, and
the size of memory operand is also doubled then.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    vaddps ymm1,ymm5,yword [esi]  ; eight sums of 32-bit float pairs
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The instructions that operate on packed integer types (in particular the ones
that earlier had been promoted from MMX to SSE) also acquired the new syntax
with three operands, however they are only allowed to operate on 128-bit
packed types and thus cannot use the whole AVX registers.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    vpavgw xmm3,xmm0,xmm2         ; average of 16-bit integers
    vpslld xmm1,xmm0,1            ; shift double words left
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
If the SSE version of instruction had a syntax with three operands, the third
one being an immediate value, the AVX version of such instruction takes four
operands, with immediate remaining the last one.

    vpalignr xmm0,xmm4,xmm2,3        ; extract byte aligned value
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The promotion to new syntax according to the rules described above has been
applied to all the instructions from SSE extensions up to SSE4, with the
exceptions described below.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>vdppd</code> instruction has syntax extended to four operans, but it does not
have a 256-bit version.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The are a few instructions, namely <code>vsqrtpd</code>, <code>vsqrtps</code>, <code>vrcpps</code> and
<code>vrsqrtps</code>, which can operate on 256-bit data size, but retained the syntax
with only two operands, because they use data from only one source:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    vsqrtpd ymm1,ymm0         ; put square roots into other register

<p class="smalltext">
In a similar way <code>vroundpd</code> and <code>vroundps</code> retained the syntax with three
operands, the last one being immediate value.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    vroundps ymm0,ymm1,0011b  ; round toward zero
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
Also some of the operations on packed integers kept their two-operand or
three-operand syntax while being promoted to AVX version. In such case these
instructions follow exactly the same rules for operands as their SSE
counterparts (since operations on packed integers do not have 256-bit variants
in AVX extension). These include <code>vpcmpestri</code>, <code>vpcmpestrm</code>, <code>vpcmpistri</code>,
<code>vpcmpistrm</code>, <code>vphminposuw</code>, <code>vpshufd</code>, <code>vpshufhw</code>, <code>vpshuflw</code>. And there are

<code>vpermd</code> and <code>vpermps</code> are new three-operand instructions, which use each
32-bit element from first source as an index of element in second source which

The family of new instructions performing <code>gather</code> operation have special
syntax, as in their memory operand they use addressing mode that is unique to
them. The base of address can be a 32-bit or 64-bit general purpose register
(the latter only in long mode), and the index (possibly multiplied by scale
value, as in standard addressing) is specified by SSE or AVX register. It is
possible to use only index without base and any numerical displacement can be
added to the address. Each of those instructions takes three operands. First
operand is the destination register, second operand is memory addressed with
a vector index, and third operand is register containing a mask. The most
significant bit of each element of mask determines whether a value will be
loaded from memory into corresponding element in destination. The address of
each element to load is determined by using the corresponding element from
index register in memory operand to calculate final address with given base
and displacement. When the index register contains less elements than the
destination and mask registers, the higher elements of destination are zeroed.
After the value is successfuly loaded, the corresponding element in mask
register is set to zero. The destination, index and mask should all be
distinct registers, it is not allowed to use the same register in two
different roles.

<h4 id="2.1.23" class="smalltext">2.1.23  Auxiliary sets of computational instructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
There is a number of additional instruction set extensions related to
AVX. They introduce new vector instructions (and sometimes also their SSE
equivalents that use classic instruction encoding), and even some new
instructions operating on general registers that use the AVX-like encoding
allowing the extended syntax with separate destination and source operands.
The CPU support for each of these instructions sets needs to be determined
separately.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The AES extension provides a specialized set of instructions for the
purpose of cryptographic computations defined by Advanced Encryption Standard.
Each of these instructions has two versions: the AVX one and the one with
SSE-like syntax that uses classic encoding. Refer to the Intel manuals for the
details of operation of these instructions.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>aesenc</code> and <code>aesenclast</code> perform a single round of AES encryption on data
from first source with a round key from second source, and store result in
destination. The destination and first source are SSE registers, and the
second source can be SSE register or 128-bit memory. The AVX versions of these
instructions, <code>vaesenc</code> and <code>vaesenclast</code>, use the syntax with three operands,
while the SSE-like version has only two operands, with first operand being
both the destination and first source.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>aesdec</code> and <code>aesdeclast</code> perform a single round of AES decryption on data
from first source with a round key from second source. The syntax rules for
them and their AVX versions are the same as for <code>aesenc</code>.

<p class="smalltext">
<code>aesimc</code> performs the InvMixColumns transformation of source operand and
store the result in destination. Both <code>aesimc</code> and <code>vaesimc</code> use only two
operands, destination being SSE register, and source being SSE register or
128-bit memory location.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>aeskeygenassist</code> is a helper instruction for generating the round key.
It needs three operands: destination being SSE register, source being SSE
register or 128-bit memory, and third operand being 8-bit immediate value.
The AVX version of this instruction uses the same syntax.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The CLMUL extension introduces just one instruction, <code>pclmulqdq</code>, and its
AVX version as well. This instruction performs a carryless multiplication of
two 64-bit values selected from first and second source according to the bit
fields in immediate value. The destination and first source are SSE registers,
second source is SSE register or 128-bit memory, and immediate value is
provided as last operand. <code>vpclmulqdq</code> takes four operands, while <code>pclmulqdq</code>
takes only three operands, with the first one serving both the role of
destination and first source.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) extension introduces additional AVX
instructions which perform multiplication and summation as single operation.
Each one takes three operands, first one serving both the role of destination
and first source, and the following ones being the second and third source.
The mnemonic of FMA instruction is obtained by appending to <code>vf</code> prefix: first
either <code>m</code> or <code>nm</code> to select whether result of multiplication should be taken
as-is or negated, then either <code>add</code> or <code>sub</code> to select whether third value
will be added to the product or subtracted from the product, then either
<code>132</code>, <code>213</code> or <code>231</code> to select which source operands are multiplied and which
one is added or subtracted, and finally the type of data on which the
instruction operates, either <code>ps</code>, <code>pd</code>, <code>ss</code> or <code>sd</code>. As it was with SSE
instructions promoted to AVX, instructions operating on packed floating point
values allow 128-bit or 256-bit syntax, in former all the operands are SSE
registers, but the third one can also be a 128-bit memory, in latter the
operands are AVX registers and the third one can also be a 256-bit memory.
Instructions that compute just one floating point result need operands to be
SSE registers, and the third operand can also be a memory, either 32-bit for
single precision or 64-bit for double precision.

In addition to the instructions created by the rule described above, there are
families of instructions with mnemonics starting with either <code>vfmaddsub</code> or
<code>vfmsubadd</code>, followed by either <code>132</code>, <code>213</code> or <code>231</code> and then either <code>ps</code> or
<code>pd</code> (the operation must always be on packed values in this case). They add
to the result of multiplication or subtract from it depending on the position
of value in packed data - instructions from the <code>vfmaddsub</code> group add when the
position is odd and subtract when the position is even, instructions from the
<code>vfmsubadd</code> group add when the position is even and subtstract when the
position is odd. The rules for operands are the same as for other FMA
instructions.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The FMA4 instructions are similar to FMA, but use syntax with four operands
and thus allow destination to be different than all the sources. Their
mnemonics are identical to FMA instructions with the <code>132</code>, <code>213</code> or <code>231</code> cut
out, as having separate destination operand makes such selection of operands
superfluous. The multiplication is always performed on values from the first
and second source, and then the value from third source is added or
subtracted. Either second or third source can be a memory operand, and the
rules for the sizes of operands are the same as for FMA instructions.

operands: destination, source, and rounding controls. The third operand is
always an immediate, the source is either SSE or AVX register containing
single precision values, and the destination is SSE register or memory, the
size of memory is 64 bits when the source is SSE register and 128 bits when
the source is AVX register. <code>vcvtph2ps</code> takes two operands, the destination
that can be SSE or AVX register, and the source that is SSE register or memory
with size of the half of destination operand's size.

The AMD XOP extension introduces a number of new vector instructions with
encoding and syntax analogous to AVX instructions. <code>vfrczps</code>, <code>vfrczss</code>,
<code>vfrczpd</code> and <code>vfrczsd</code> extract fractional portions of single or double
precision values, they all take two operands. The packed operations allow
either SSE or AVX register as destination, for the other two it has to be SSE
register. Source can be register of the same type as destination, or memory
of appropriate size (256-bit for destination being AVX register, 128-bit for
packed operation with destination being SSE register, 64-bit for operation
on a solitary double precision value and 32-bit for operation on a solitary
single precision value).

The family of packed comparison instructions take four operands, the
destination and first source being SSE register, second source being SSE
register or 128-bit memory and the fourth operand being immediate value
defining the type of comparison. The mnemonic or instruction is created
by appending to <code>vpcom</code> prefix either <code>b</code> or <code>ub</code> to compare signed or
unsigned bytes, <code>w</code> or <code>uw</code> to compare signed or unsigned words, <code>d</code> or <code>ud</code>
to compare signed or unsigned double words, <code>q</code> or <code>uq</code> to compare signed or
unsigned quad words. The respective values from the first and second source

In addition to new operand sizes and registers, the AVX-512 introduces
a number of supplementary settings that can be included in the operands
of AVX instructions.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The destination operand of the most of AVX instructions can be followed
by the name of an opmask register enclosed in braces, this modifier
specifies a mask that decides which units of data in the destination
operand are going to be updated. The <code>k0</code> register cannot be used as a
destination mask. This setting can be further followed by <code>{z}</code> modifier
to choose that the data units not selected by mask should be zeroed
instead of leaving them unchanged.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    vaddpd zmm1{k1},zmm5,zword [rsi]  ; update selected floats
    vaddps ymm6{k1}{z},ymm12,ymm24    ; update selected, zero other ones
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
When an instruction that operates on packed data has a source operand
loaded from a memory, the memory location may be just a single unit of data
and the source used for the operation is created by broadcasting this
value into all the units within the required size. To specify that such
broadcasting method is used the memory operand should be followed by one
of the <code>{1to2}</code>, <code>{1to4}</code>, <code>{1to8}</code>, <code>{1to16}</code>, <code>{1to32}</code> and <code>{1to64}</code>
modifiers, selecting the appropriate multiply of a unit.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    vsubps zmm1,zmm2,dword [rsi] {1to16} ; subtract from all floats
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
When an instruction does not use a memory operand often an additional
operand may follow the source operands, containing the rounding mode
specifier. When an instruction has variants that operate on different
sizes of data, the rounding mode can be specified only when the
register operands are 512-bit.

<h4 id="2.1.25" class="smalltext">2.1.25  Other extensions of instruction set</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
There is a number of additional instruction set extensions recognized by flat
assembler, and the general syntax of the instructions introduced by those
extensions is provided here. For a detailed information on the operations
performed by them, check out the manuals from Intel (for the VMX, SMX, XSAVE,
RDRAND, FSGSBASE, INVPCID, HLE, RTM and MPX extensions) or AMD (for the SVM extension).
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The Virtual-Machine Extensions (VMX) provide a set of instructions for the
management of virtual machines. The <code>vmxon</code> instruction, which enters the VMX
operation, requires a single 64-bit memory operand, which should be a physical
address of memory region, which the logical processor may use to support VMX
operation. The <code>vmxoff</code> instruction, which leaves the VMX operation, has no
operands. The <code>vmlaunch</code> and <code>vmresume</code>, which launch or resume the virtual
machines, and <code>vmcall</code>, which allows guest software to call the VM monitor,
use no operands either.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>vmptrld</code> loads the physical address of current Virtual Machine Control
Structure (VMCS) from its memory operand, <code>vmptrst</code> stores the pointer to
current VMCS into address specified by its memory operand, and <code>vmclear</code> sets
the launch state of the VMCS referenced by its memory operand to clear. These
three instruction all require single 64-bit memory operand.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>vmread</code> reads from VCMS a field specified by the source operand and
stores it into the destination operand. The source operand should be a
general purpose register, and the destination operand can be a register of
memory. The <code>vmwrite</code> writes into a VMCS field specified by the destination
operand the value provided by source operand. The source operand can be a
general purpose register or memory, and the destination operand must be a
register. The size of operands for those instructions should be 64-bit when
in long mode, and 32-bit otherwise.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>invept</code> and <code>invvpid</code> invalidate the translation lookaside buffers
(TLBs) and paging-structure caches, either derived from extended page tables
(EPT), or based on the virtual processor identifier (VPID). These instructions
require two operands, the first one being the general purpose register
specifying the type of invalidation, and the second one being a 128-bit
memory operand providing the invalidation descriptor. The first operand
should be a 64-bit register when in long mode, and 32-bit register otherwise.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The Safer Mode Extensions (SMX) provide the functionalities available
throught the <code>getsec</code> instruction. This instruction takes no operands, and
the function that is executed is determined by the contents of EAX register
upon executing this instruction.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The Secure Virtual Machine (SVM) is a variant of virtual machine extension
used by AMD. The <code>skinit</code> instruction securely reinitializes the processor
allowing the startup of trusted software, such as the virtual machine monitor
(VMM). This instruction takes a single operand, which must be EAX, and
provides a physical address of the secure loader block (SLB).
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>vmrun</code> instruction is used to start a guest virtual machine,
its only operand should be an accumulator register (AX, EAX or RAX, the
last one available only in long mode) providing the physical address of the
virtual machine control block (VMCB). The <code>vmsave</code> stores a subset of
processor state into VMCB specified by its operand, and <code>vmload</code> loads the
same subset of processor state from a specified VMCB. The same operand rules
as for the <code>vmrun</code> apply to those two instructions.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>vmmcall</code> allows the guest software to call the VMM. This instruction takes
no operands.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>stgi</code> set the global interrupt flag to 1, and <code>clgi</code> zeroes it. These
instructions take no operands.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>invlpga</code> invalidates the TLB mapping for a virtual page specified by the
first operand (which has to be accumulator register) and address space
identifier specified by the second operand (which must be ECX register).
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The XSAVE set of instructions allows to save and restore processor state
components. <code>xsave</code> and <code>xsaveopt</code> store the components of processor state
defined by bit mask in EDX and EAX registers into area defined by memory
operand. <code>xrstor</code> restores from the area specified by memory operand the
components of processor state defined by mask in EDX and EAX. The <code>xsave64</code>,
<code>xsaveopt64</code> and <code>xrstor64</code> are 64-bit versions of these instructions, allowed
only in long mode.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>xgetbv</code> read the contents of 64-bit XCR (extended control register)
specified in ECX register into EDX and EAX registers. <code>xsetbv</code> writes the
contents of EDX and EAX into the 64-bit XCR specified by ECX register. These
instructions have no operands.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The RDRAND extension introduces one new instruction, <code>rdrand</code>, which loads
the hardware-generated random value into general register. It takes one
operand, which can be 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit register (with the last one
being allowed only in long mode).
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The FSGSBASE extension adds long mode instructions that allow to read and
write the segment base registers for FS and GS segments. <code>rdfsbase</code> and
<code>rdgsbase</code> read the corresponding segment base registers into operand, while
<code>wrfsbase</code> and <code>wrgsbase</code> write the value of operand into those register.
All these instructions take one operand, which can be 32-bit or 64-bit general
register.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The INVPCID extension adds <code>invpcid</code> instruction, which invalidates mapping
in the TLBs and paging caches based on the invalidation type specified in
first operand and PCID invalidate descriptor specified in second operand.
The first operands should be 32-bit general register when not in long mode,
or 64-bit general register when in long mode. The second operand should be
128-bit memory location.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The HLE and RTM extensions provide set of instructions for the transactional
management. The <code>xacquire</code> and <code>xrelease</code> are new prefixes that can be used
with some of the instructions to start or end lock elision on the memory
address specified by prefixed instruction. The <code>xbegin</code> instruction starts
the transactional execution, its operand is the address a fallback routine
that gets executes in case of transaction abort, specified like the operand
for near jump instruction. <code>xend</code> marks the end of transcational execution
region, it takes no operands. <code>xabort</code> forces the transaction abort, it takes
an 8-bit immediate value as its only operand, this value is passed in the
highest bits of EAX to the fallback routine. <code>xtest</code> checks whether there is
transactional execution in progress, this instruction takes no operands.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The MPX extension adds instructions that operate on new bounds registers
and aid in checking the memory references. For some of these instructions
flat assemblers allows a special syntax that allows a fine control over their
operation, where an address of a memory operand is separated into two parts
with a comma. With <code>bndmk</code> instruction the first part of such address specifies
the lower bound and the second one the upper bound. The lower bound can be
either zero or a register, the upper bound can be any address that uses no more
than one register (multiplied by 1, 2, 4, or 8). The addressing registers need to
be 64-bit when in long mode, and 32-bit otherwise.
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    bndmk bnd0,[rbx,100000h] ; lower bound in register, upper directly
    bndmk bnd1,[0,rbx]       ; lower bound zero, upper in register
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
In case of <code>bndldx</code> and <code>bndstx</code>, the first part of memory operand specifies an
address used to access a bound table entry, while the second part is either zero
or a register that plays a role of an additional operand for such instruction.
The address in the first part may use no more than one register and the register
cannot be multiplied by a number other than 1.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="smallcode">    bndstx [rcx,rsi],bnd3  ; store bnd3 and rsi at rcx in the bound table
    bndldx bnd2,[rcx,rsi]  ; load from bound table if entry matches rsi
</pre>

<h3 id="2.2" class="mediumtext">2.2  Control directives</h3>

<p class="smalltext">
This section describes the directives that control the assembly process, they
are processed during the assembly and may cause some blocks of instructions
to be assembled differently or not assembled at all.
</p>

<h4 id="2.2.1" class="smalltext">2.2.1  Numerical constants</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
The <code>=</code> directive allows to define the numerical constant. It should be
preceded by the name for the constant and followed by the numerical expression
providing the value. The value of such constants can be a number or an address,
but - unlike labels - the numerical constants are not allowed to hold the
register-based addresses. Besides this difference, in their basic variant
numerical constants behave very much like labels and you can even
forward-reference them (access their values before they actually get defined).
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
There is, however, a second variant of numerical constants, which is
recognized by assembler when you try to define the constant of name, under
which there already was a numerical constant defined. In such case assembler
treats that constant as an assembly-time variable and allows it to be assigned
with new value, but forbids forward-referencing it (for obvious reasons). Let's
see both the variant of numerical constants in one example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    dd sum
    x = 1
    x = x+2
    sum = x
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
Here the <code>x</code> is an assembly-time variable, and every time it is accessed, the
value that was assigned to it the most recently is used. Thus if we tried to
access the <code>x</code> before it gets defined the first time, like if we wrote <code>dd&nbsp;x</code>
in place of the <code>dd&nbsp;sum</code> instruction, it would cause an error. And when it is
re-defined with the <code>x&nbsp;=&nbsp;x+2</code> directive, the previous value of <code>x</code> is used to
calculate the new one. So when the <code>sum</code> constant gets defined, the <code>x</code> has
value of 3, and this value is assigned to the <code>sum</code>. Since this one is defined
only once in source, it is the standard numerical constant, and can be
forward-referenced. So the <code>dd&nbsp;sum</code> is assembled as <code>dd&nbsp;3</code>. To read more about
how the assembler is able to resolve this, see section <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#2.2.6">2.2.6</a>.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The value of numerical constant can be preceded by size operator, which can
ensure that the value will fit in the range for the specified size, and can
affect also how some of the calculations inside the numerical expression are
performed. This example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    c8 = byte -1
    c32 = dword -1
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
defines two different constants, the first one fits in 8 bits, the second one
fits in 32 bits.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
When you need to define constant with the value of address, which may be
register-based (and thus you cannot employ numerical constant for this
purpose), you can use the extended syntax of <code>label</code> directive (already
described in section <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#1.2.3">1.2.3</a>), like:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    label myaddr at ebp+4
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
which declares label placed at <code>ebp+4</code> address. However remember that labels,
unlike numerical constants, cannot become assembly-time variables.
</p>

<h4 id="2.2.2" class="smalltext">2.2.2  Conditional assembly</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>if</code> directive causes come block of instructions to be assembled only under
certain condition. It should be followed by logical expression specifying the
condition, instructions in next lines will be assembled only when this
condition is met, otherwise they will be skipped. The optional <code>else&nbsp;if</code>
directive followed with logical expression specifying additional condition
begins the next block of instructions that will be assembled if previous
conditions were not met, and the additional condition is met. The optional
<code>else</code> directive begins the block of instructions that will be assembled if
all the conditions were not met. The <code>end&nbsp;if</code> directive ends the last block of
instructions.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
You should note that <code>if</code> directive is processed at assembly stage and
therefore it doesn't affect any preprocessor directives, like the definitions
of symbolic constants and macroinstructions - when the assembler recognizes the
<code>if</code> directive, all the preprocessing has been already finished.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The logical expression consist of logical values and logical operators. The
logical operators are <code>~</code> for logical negation, <code>&amp;</code> for logical and, <code>|</code> for
logical or. The negation has the highest priority. Logical value can be a
numerical expression, it will be false if it is equal to zero, otherwise it
will be true. Two numerical expression can be compared using one of the
following operators to make the logical value: <code>=</code> (equal), <code>&lt;</code> (less),
<code>&gt;</code> (greater), <code>&lt;=</code> (less or equal), <code>&gt;=</code> (greater or equal),
<code>&lt;&gt;</code> (not equal).
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>used</code> operator followed by a symbol name, is the logical value that
checks whether the given symbol is used somewhere (it returns correct result
even if symbol is used only after this check). The <code>defined</code> operator can be
followed by any expression, usually just by a single symbol name; it checks
whether the given expression contains only symbols that are defined in the
source and accessible from the current position.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
With <code>relativeto</code> operator it is possible to check whether values of two
expressions differ only by constant amount. The valid syntax is a numerical
expression followed by <code>relativeto</code> and then another expression (possibly
register-based). Labels that have no simple numerical value can be tested
this way to determine what kind of operations may be possible with them.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The following simple example uses the <code>count</code> constant that should be
defined somewhere in source:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    if count&gt;0
        mov cx,count
        rep movsb
    end if
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
These two assembly instructions will be assembled only if the <code>count</code> constant
is greater than 0. The next sample shows more complex conditional structure:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    if count &amp; ~ count mod 4
        mov cx,count/4
        rep movsd
    else if count&gt;4
        mov cx,count/4
        rep movsd
        mov cx,count mod 4
        rep movsb
    else
        mov cx,count
        rep movsb
    end if
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The first block of instructions gets assembled when the <code>count</code> is non zero and
divisible by four, if this condition is not met, the second logical expression,
which follows the <code>else&nbsp;if</code>, is evaluated and if it's true, the second block
of instructions get assembled, otherwise the last block of instructions, which
follows the line containing only <code>else</code>, is assembled.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
There are also operators that allow comparison of values being any chains of
symbols. The <code>eq</code> compares whether two such values are exactly the same.
The <code>in</code> operator checks whether given value is a member of the list of values
following this operator, the list should be enclosed between <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>
characters, its members should be separated with commas. The symbols are
considered the same when they have the same meaning for the assembler - for
example <code>pword</code> and <code>fword</code> for assembler are the same and thus are not
distinguished by the above operators. In the same way <code>16&nbsp;eq&nbsp;10h</code> is the true
condition, however <code>16&nbsp;eq&nbsp;10+4</code> is not.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>eqtype</code> operator checks whether the two compared values have the same
structure, and whether the structural elements are of the same type. The
distinguished types include numerical expressions, individual quoted strings,
floating point numbers, address expressions (the expressions enclosed in square
brackets or preceded by <code>ptr</code> operator), instruction mnemonics, registers, size
operators, jump type and code type operators. And each of the special
characters that act as a separators, like comma or colon, is the separate type
itself. For example, two values, each one consisting of register name followed
by comma and numerical expression, will be regarded as of the same type, no
matter what kind of register and how complicated numerical expression is used;
with exception for the quoted strings and floating point values, which are the
special kinds of numerical expressions and are treated as different types. Thus
<code>eax,16&nbsp;eqtype&nbsp;fs,3+7</code> condition is true, but <code>eax,16&nbsp;eqtype&nbsp;eax,1.6</code> is false.
</p>

<h4 id="2.2.3" class="smalltext">2.2.3  Repeating blocks of instructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>times</code> directive repeats one instruction specified number of times. It
should be followed by numerical expression specifying number of repeats and
the instruction to repeat (optionally colon can be used to separate number and
instruction). When special symbol <code>%</code> is used inside the instruction, it is
equal to the number of current repeat. For example <code>times&nbsp;5&nbsp;db&nbsp;%</code> will define
five bytes with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Recursive use of <code>times</code> directive is
also allowed, so <code>times&nbsp;3&nbsp;times&nbsp;%&nbsp;db&nbsp;%</code> will define six bytes with values
1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>repeat</code> directive repeats the whole block of instructions. It should be
followed by numerical expression specifying number of repeats. Instructions
to repeat are expected in next lines, ended with the <code>end&nbsp;repeat</code> directive,
for example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    repeat 8
        mov byte [bx],%
        inc bx
    end repeat
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The generated code will store byte values from one to eight in the memory
addressed by BX register.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Number of repeats can be zero, in that case the instructions are not
assembled at all.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>break</code> directive allows to stop repeating earlier and continue assembly
from the first line after the <code>end repeat</code>. Combined with the <code>if</code> directive it
allows to stop repeating under some special condition, like:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    s = x/2
    repeat 100
        if x/s = s
            break
        end if
        s = (s+x/s)/2
    end repeat
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>while</code> directive repeats the block of instructions as long as the
condition specified by the logical expression following it is true. The block
of instructions to be repeated should end with the <code>end&nbsp;while</code> directive.
Before each repetition the logical expression is evaluated and when its value
is false, the assembly is continued starting from the first line after the
<code>end&nbsp;while</code>. Also in this case the <code>%</code> symbol holds the number of current
repeat. The <code>break</code> directive can be used to stop this kind of loop in the same
way as with <code>repeat</code> directive. The previous sample can be rewritten to use the
<code>while</code> instead of <code>repeat</code> this way:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    s = x/2
    while x/s &lt;&gt; s
        s = (s+x/s)/2
        if % = 100
            break
        end if
    end while
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The blocks defined with <code>if</code>, <code>repeat</code> and <code>while</code> can be nested in any order,
however they should be closed in the same order in which they were started. The
<code>break</code> directive always stops processing the block that was started last with
either the <code>repeat</code> or <code>while</code> directive.
</p>

<h4 id="2.2.4" class="smalltext">2.2.4  Addressing spaces</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>org</code> directive sets address at which the following code is expected to
appear in memory. It should be followed by numerical expression specifying
the address. This directive begins the new addressing space, the following
code itself is not moved in any way, but all the labels defined within it
and the value of <code>$</code> symbol are affected as if it was put at the given
address. However it's the responsibility of programmer to put the code at
correct address at run-time.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>load</code> directive allows to define constant with a binary value loaded
from the already assembled code. This directive should be followed by the name
of the constant, then optionally size operator, then <code>from</code> operator and a
numerical expression specifying a valid address in current addressing space.
The size operator has unusual meaning in this case - it states how many bytes
(up to 8) have to be loaded to form the binary value of constant. If no size
operator is specified, one byte is loaded (thus value is in range from 0 to
255). The loaded data cannot exceed current offset.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>store</code> directive can modify the already generated code by replacing
some of the previously generated data with the value defined by given
numerical expression, which follows. The expression can be preceded by the
optional size operator to specify how large value the expression defines, and
therefore how much bytes will be stored, if there is no size operator, the
size of one byte is assumed. Then the <code>at</code> operator and the numerical
expression defining the valid address in current addressing code space, at
which the given value have to be stored should follow. This is a directive for
advanced appliances and should be used carefully.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Both <code>load</code> and <code>store</code> directives in their basic variant (defined above) are limited to operate on places in
current addressing space. The <code>$$</code> symbol is always equal to the base address
of current addressing space, and the <code>$</code> symbol is the address of current
position in that addressing space, therefore these two values define limits
of the area, where <code>load</code> and <code>store</code> can operate.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Combining the <code>load</code> and <code>store</code> directives allows to do things like encoding
some of the already generated code. For example to encode the whole code
generated in current addressing space you can use such block of directives:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    repeat $-$$
        load a byte from $$+%-1
        store byte a xor c at $$+%-1
    end repeat
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
and each byte of code will be xored with the value defined by <code>c</code> constant.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>virtual</code> defines virtual data at specified address. This data will not be
included in the output file, but labels defined there can be used in other
parts of source. This directive can be followed by <code>at</code> operator and the
numerical expression specifying the address for virtual data, otherwise is
uses current address, the same as <code>virtual&nbsp;at&nbsp;$</code>. Instructions defining data
are expected in next lines, ended with <code>end&nbsp;virtual</code> directive. The block of
virtual instructions itself is an independent addressing space, after it's
ended, the context of previous addressing space is restored.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>virtual</code> directive can be used to create union of some variables, for
example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    GDTR dp ?
    virtual at GDTR
        GDT_limit dw ?
        GDT_address dd ?
    end virtual
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
It defines two labels for parts of the 48-bit variable at <code>GDTR</code> address.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
It can be also used to define labels for some structures addressed by a
register, for example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    virtual at bx
        LDT_limit dw ?
        LDT_address dd ?
    end virtual
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
With such definition instruction <code>mov&nbsp;ax,[LDT_limit]</code> will be assembled
to the same instruction as <code>mov&nbsp;ax,[bx]</code>.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Declaring defined data values or instructions inside the virtual block could
also be useful, because the <code>load</code> directive may be used to load the values
from the virtually generated code into a constants. This directive in its basic version should be
used after the code it loads but before the virtual block ends, because it can
only load the values from the same addressing space. For example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    virtual at 0
        xor eax,eax
        and edx,eax
        load zeroq dword from 0
    end virtual
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The above piece of code will define the <code>zeroq</code> constant containing four bytes
of the machine code of the instructions defined inside the virtual block.
This method can be also used to load some binary value from external file.
For example this code:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    virtual at 0
        file 'a.txt':10h,1
        load char from 0
    end virtual
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
loads the single byte from offset 10h in file <code>a.txt</code> into the <code>char</code>
constant.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Any of the <code>section</code> directives described in <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#2.4">2.4</a> also begins a new
addressing space.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
It is possible to declare a special kind of label that marks the current
addressing space, by appending a double colon instead of a single one after a
label name. This symbol cannot then be used in numerical expressions, the only
place where it is allowed to use it is the extended syntax of <code>load</code> and
<code>store</code> directives. It is possible to make these directives operate on a
different addressing space than the current one, by specifying address with
the two components: first the name of a special label that marks the
addressing space, followed by the colon character and a numerical expression
defining a valid address inside that addressing space. In the following
example this extended syntax is used to load the value from a block after it
has been closed:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    virtual at 0
        hex_digits::
        db '0123456789ABCDEF'
    end virtual
    load a byte from hex_digits:10
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
This way it is possible to operate on values inside any code block,
including all the ones defined with <code>virtual</code>. However it is not allowed to
specify addressing space that has not been assembled yet, just as it is not
allowed to specify an address in the current addressing space that exceeds
the current offset. The addresses in any other addressing space are also
limited by the boundaries of the block.
</p>


<h4 id="2.2.5" class="smalltext">2.2.5  Other directives</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>align</code> directive aligns code or data to the specified boundary. It should
be followed by a numerical expression specifying the number of bytes, to the
multiply of which the current address has to be aligned. The boundary value
has to be the power of two.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>align</code> directive fills the bytes that had to be skipped to perform the
alignment with the <code>nop</code> instructions and at the same time marks this area as
uninitialized data, so if it is placed among other uninitialized data that
wouldn't take space in the output file, the alignment bytes will act the same
way. If you need to fill the alignment area with some other values, you can
combine <code>align</code> with <code>virtual</code> to get the size of alignment needed and then
create the alignment yourself, like:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    virtual
        align 16
        a = $ - $$
    end virtual
    db a dup 0
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>a</code> constant is defined to be the difference between address after alignment
and address of the <code>virtual</code> block (see previous section), so it is equal to
the size of needed alignment space.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>display</code> directive displays the message at the assembly time. It should
be followed by the quoted strings or byte values, separated with commas. It
can be used to display values of some constants, for example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    bits = 16
    display 'Current offset is 0x'
    repeat bits/4
        d = '0' + $ shr (bits-%*4) and 0Fh
        if d &gt; '9'
            d = d + 'A'-'9'-1
        end if
        display d
    end repeat
    display 13,10
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
This block of directives calculates the four hexadecimal digits of 16-bit value
and converts them into characters for displaying. Note that this will not work if
the adresses in current addressing space are relocatable (as it might happen with
PE or object output formats), since only absolute values can be used this way.
The absolute value may be obtained by calculating the relative address, like
<code>$-$$</code>, or <code>rva&nbsp;$</code> in case of PE format.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>err</code> directive immediately terminates the assembly process when it is
encountered by assembler.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>assert</code> directive tests whether the logical expression that follows it
is true, and if not, it signalizes the error.
</p>

<h4 id="2.2.6" class="smalltext">2.2.6  Multiple passes</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
Because the assembler allows to reference some of the labels or constants
before they get actually defined, it has to predict the values of such labels
and if there is even a suspicion that prediction failed in at least one case,
it does one more pass, assembling the whole source, this time doing better
prediction based on the values the labels got in the previous pass.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The changing values of labels can cause some instructions to have encodings
of different length, and this can cause the change in values of labels again.
And since the labels and constants can also be used inside the expressions that
affect the behavior of control directives, the whole block of source can be
processed completely differently during the new pass. Thus the assembler does
more and more passes, each time trying to do better predictions to approach
the final solution, when all the values get predicted correctly. It uses
various method for predicting the values, which has been chosen to allow
finding in a few passes the solution of possibly smallest length for the most
of the programs.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Some of the errors, like the values not fitting in required boundaries, are
not signaled during those intermediate passes, since it may happen that when
some of the values are predicted better, these errors will disappear. However
if assembler meets some illegal syntax construction or unknown instruction, it
always stops immediately. Also defining some label more than once causes such
error, because it makes the predictions groundless.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Only the messages created
with the <code>display</code> directive during the last performed pass get actually
displayed. In case when the assembly has been
stopped due to an error, these messages may reflect the predicted values that
are not yet resolved correctly.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The solution may sometimes not exist and in such cases the assembler will
never manage to make correct predictions - for this reason there is a limit for
a number of passes, and when assembler reaches this limit, it stops and displays
the message that it is not able to generate the correct output. Consider the
following example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    if ~ defined alpha
        alpha:
    end if
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>defined</code> operator gives the true value when the expression following it
could be calculated in this place, what in this case means that the <code>alpha</code>
label is defined somewhere. But the above block causes this label to be defined
only when the value given by <code>defined</code> operator is false, what leads to an
antynomy and makes it impossible to resolve such code. When processing the <code>if</code>
directive assembler has to predict whether the <code>alpha</code> label will be defined
somewhere (it wouldn't have to predict only if the label was already defined
earlier in this pass), and whatever the prediction is, the opposite always
happens. Thus the assembly will fail, unless the <code>alpha</code> label is defined
somewhere in source preceding the above block of instructions - in such case,
as it was already noted, the prediction is not needed and the block will just
get skipped.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The above sample might have been written as a try to define the label only
when it was not yet defined. It fails, because the <code>defined</code> operator does
check whether the label is defined anywhere, and this includes the definition
inside this conditionally processed block. However adding some additional
condition may make it possible to get it resolved:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    if ~ defined alpha | defined @f
        alpha:
        @@:
    end if
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>@f</code> is always the same label as the nearest <code>@@</code> symbol in the source
following it, so the above sample would mean the same if any unique name was
used instead of the anonymous label. When <code>alpha</code> is not defined in any other
place in source, the only possible solution is when this block gets defined,
and this time this doesn't lead to the antynomy, because of the anonymous
label which makes this block self-establishing. To better understand this,
look at the blocks that has nothing more than this self-establishing:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    if defined @f
        @@:
    end if
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
This is an example of source that may have more than one solution, as both
cases when this block gets processed or not are equally correct. Which one of
those two solutions we get depends on the algorithm on the assembler, in case
of flat assembler - on the algorithm of predictions. Back to the previous
sample, when <code>alpha</code> is not defined anywhere else, the condition for <code>if</code> block
cannot be false, so we are left with only one possible solution, and we can
hope the assembler will arrive at it. On the other hand, when <code>alpha</code> is
defined in some other place, we've got two possible solutions again, but one of
them causes <code>alpha</code> to be defined twice, and such an error causes assembler to
abort the assembly immediately, as this is the kind of error that deeply
disturbs the process of resolving. So we can get such source either correctly
resolved or causing an error, and what we get may depend on the internal
choices made by the assembler.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
However there are some facts about such choices that are certain. When
assembler has to check whether the given symbol is defined and it was already
defined in the current pass, no prediction is needed - it was already noted
above. And when the given symbol has been defined never before, including all
the already finished passes, the assembler predicts it to be not defined.
Knowing this, we can expect that the simple self-establishing block shown
above will not be assembled at all and that the previous sample will resolve
correctly when <code>alpha</code> is defined somewhere before our conditional block,
while it will itself define <code>alpha</code> when it's not already defined earlier, thus
potentially causing the error because of double definition if the <code>alpha</code> is
also defined somewhere later.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>used</code> operator may be expected to behave in a similar manner in
analogous cases, however any other kinds of predictions may not be so simple and
you should never rely on them this way.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>err</code> directive, usually used to stop the assembly when some condition is
met, stops the assembly immediately, regardless of whether the current pass
is final or intermediate. So even when the condition that caused this directive
to be interpreted is temporary, and would eventually disappear in the later
passes, the assembly is stopped anyway.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>assert</code> directive signalizes the error only if its expression is false
after all the symbols have been resolved. You can use <code>assert&nbsp;0</code> in place of
<code>err</code> when you do not want to have assembly stopped during the intermediate
passes.
</p>


<h3 id="2.3" class="mediumtext">2.3  Preprocessor directives</h3>

<p class="smalltext">
All preprocessor directives are processed before the main assembly process,
and therefore are not affected by the control directives. At this time also
all comments are stripped out.
</p>

<h4 id="2.3.1" class="smalltext">2.3.1  Including source files</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>include</code> directive includes the specified source file at the position where
it is used. It should be followed by the quoted name of file that should be
included, for example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    include 'macros.inc'
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The whole included file is preprocessed before preprocessing the lines next
to the line containing the <code>include</code> directive. There are no limits to the
number of included files as long as they fit in memory.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The quoted path can contain environment variables enclosed within <code>%</code>
characters, they will be replaced with their values inside the path, both the
<code>\</code> and <code>/</code> characters are allowed as a path separators.
The file is first searched for in the directory containing file which included it and when it is
not found there, the search is continued in the directories specified in the
environment variable called INCLUDE (the multiple paths separated with
semicolons can be defined there, they will be searched in the same order as
specified). If file was not found in any of these places, preprocessor looks
for it in the directory containing the main source file (the one specified in
command line). These rules concern also paths given with the <code>file</code> directive.
</p>

<h4 id="2.3.2" class="smalltext">2.3.2  Symbolic constants</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
The symbolic constants are different from the numerical constants, before the
assembly process they are replaced with their values everywhere in source
lines after their definitions, and anything can become their values.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The definition of symbolic constant consists of name of the constant
followed by the <code>equ</code> directive. Everything that follows this directive will
become the value of constant. If the value of symbolic constant contains
other symbolic constants, they are replaced with their values before assigning
this value to the new constant. For example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    d equ dword
    NULL equ d 0
    d equ edx
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
After these three definitions the value of <code>NULL</code> constant is <code>dword 0</code> and
the value of <code>d</code> is <code>edx</code>. So, for example, <code>push NULL</code> will be assembled as
<code>push dword 0</code> and <code>push d</code> will be assembled as <code>push edx</code>.
And if then the following line was put:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    d equ d,eax
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
the <code>d</code> constant would get the new value of <code>edx,eax</code>. This way the growing
lists of symbols can be defined.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>restore</code> directive allows to get back previous value of redefined symbolic
constant. It should be followed by one more names of symbolic constants,
separated with commas. So <code>restore d</code> after the above definitions will give
<code>d</code> constant back the value <code>edx</code>, the second one will restore it to value
<code>dword</code>, and one more will revert <code>d</code> to original meaning as if no such
constant was defined. If there was no constant defined of given name,
<code>restore</code> will not cause an error, it will be just ignored.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Symbolic constant can be used to adjust the syntax of assembler to personal
preferences. For example the following set of definitions provides the handy
shortcuts for all the size operators:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    b equ byte
    w equ word
    d equ dword
    p equ pword
    f equ fword
    q equ qword
    t equ tword
    x equ dqword
    y equ qqword
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
Because symbolic constant may also have an empty value, it can be used to
allow the syntax with <code>offset</code> word before any address value:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    offset equ
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
After this definition <code>mov ax,offset char</code> will be valid construction for
copying the offset of <code>char</code> variable into <code>ax</code> register, because <code>offset</code> is
replaced with an empty value, and therefore ignored.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>define</code> directive followed by the name of constant and then the value,
is the alternative way of defining symbolic constant. The only difference
between <code>define</code> and <code>equ</code> is that
<code>define</code> assigns the value as it is,
it does not replace the symbolic constants with their values inside it.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Symbolic constants can also be defined with the <code>fix</code> directive, which has
the same syntax as <code>equ</code>, but defines constants of high priority - they are
replaced with their symbolic values even before processing the preprocessor
directives and macroinstructions, the only exception is <code>fix</code> directive
itself, which has the highest possible priority, so it allows redefinition of
constants defined this way.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>fix</code> directive can be used for syntax adjustments related to directives
of preprocessor, what cannot be done with <code>equ</code> directive. For example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    incl fix include
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
defines a short name for <code>include</code> directive, while the similar definition done
with <code>equ</code> directive wouldn't give such result, as standard symbolic constants
are replaced with their values after searching the line for preprocessor
directives.
</p>

<h4 id="2.3.3" class="smalltext">2.3.3  Macroinstructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>macro</code> directive allows you to define your own complex instructions, called
macroinstructions, using which can greatly simplify the process of
programming. In its simplest form it's similar to symbolic constant
definition. For example the following definition defines a shortcut for the
<code>test al,0xFF</code> instruction:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro tst {test al,0xFF}
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
After the <code>macro</code> directive there is a name of macroinstruction and then its
contents enclosed between the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> characters. You can use <code>tst</code>
instruction anywhere after this definition and it will be assembled as
<code>test al,0xFF</code>. Defining symbolic constant <code>tst</code> of that value would give the
similar result, but the difference is that the name of macroinstruction is
recognized only as an instruction mnemonic. Also, macroinstructions are
replaced with corresponding code even before the symbolic constants are
replaced with their values. So if you define macroinstruction and symbolic
constant of the same name, and use this name as an instruction mnemonic, it
will be replaced with the contents of macroinstruction, but it will be
replaced with value if symbolic constant if used somewhere inside the
operands.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The definition of macroinstruction can consist of many lines, because
<code>{</code> and <code>}</code> characters don't have to be in the same line as <code>macro</code> directive.
For example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro stos0
     {
        xor al,al
        stosb
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The macroinstruction <code>stos0</code> will be replaced with these two assembly
instructions anywhere it's used.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Like instructions which needs some number of operands, the macroinstruction
can be defined to need some number of arguments separated with commas. The
names of needed argument should follow the name of macroinstruction in the
line of <code>macro</code> directive and should be separated with commas if there is more
than one. Anywhere one of these names occurs in the contents of
macroinstruction, it will be replaced with corresponding value, provided when
the macroinstruction is used. Here is an example of a macroinstruction that
will do data alignment for binary output format:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro align value { rb (value-1)-($+value-1) mod value }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
When the <code>align 4</code> instruction is found after this macroinstruction is
defined, it will be replaced with contents of this macroinstruction, and the
<code>value</code> will there become 4, so the result will be <code>rb (4-1)-($+4-1) mod 4</code>.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
If a macroinstruction is defined that uses an instruction with the same name
inside its definition, the previous meaning of this name is used. Useful
redefinition of macroinstructions can be done in that way, for example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro mov op1,op2
     {
      if op1 in &lt;ds,es,fs,gs,ss&gt; &amp; op2 in &lt;cs,ds,es,fs,gs,ss&gt;
        push  op2
        pop   op1
      else
        mov   op1,op2
      end if
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
This macroinstruction extends the syntax of <code>mov</code> instruction, allowing both
operands to be segment registers. For example <code>mov ds,es</code> will be assembled as
<code>push es</code> and <code>pop ds</code>. In all other cases the standard <code>mov</code> instruction will
be used. The syntax of this <code>mov</code> can be extended further by defining next
macroinstruction of that name, which will use the previous macroinstruction:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro mov op1,op2,op3
     {
      if op3 eq
        mov   op1,op2
      else
        mov   op1,op2
        mov   op2,op3
      end if
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
It allows <code>mov</code> instruction to have three operands, but it can still have two
operands only, because when macroinstruction is given less arguments than it
needs, the rest of arguments will have empty values. When three operands are
given, this macroinstruction will become two macroinstructions of the previous
definition, so <code>mov es,ds,dx</code> will be assembled as <code>push ds</code>, <code>pop es</code> and
<code>mov ds,dx</code>.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
By placing the <code>*</code> after the name of argument you can mark the argument as
required - preprocessor will not allow it to have an empty value. For example the
above macroinstruction could be declared as <code>macro&nbsp;mov&nbsp;op1*,op2*,op3</code> to make
sure that first two arguments will always have to be given some non empty
values.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Alternatively, you can provide the default value for argument, by placing
the <code>=</code> followed by value after the name of argument. Then if the argument
has an empty value provided, the default value will be used instead.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
When it's needed to provide macroinstruction with argument that contains
some commas, such argument should be enclosed between <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> characters.
If it contains more than one <code>&lt;</code> character, the same number of <code>&gt;</code> should be
used to tell that the value of argument ends.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
When the name of the last argument of macroinstruction is followed by <code>&amp;</code>
character, this argument consumes everything up to the end of line, including
commas.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>purge</code> directive allows removing the last definition of specified
macroinstruction. It should be followed by one or more names of
macroinstructions, separated with commas. If such macroinstruction has not
been defined, you will not get any error. For example after having the syntax of
<code>mov</code> extended with the macroinstructions defined above, you can disable
syntax with three operands back by using <code>purge mov</code> directive. Next
<code>purge mov</code> will disable also syntax for two operands being segment registers,
and all the next such directives will do nothing.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
If after the <code>macro</code> directive you enclose some group of argument declarations
in square brackets, it will allow giving more values for this group of arguments
when using that macroinstruction.  Any additional argument following the last
argument of such group will start the new group and will become the first
argument of it. For this reason after the closing square bracket no more argument
names can follow. The contents of macroinstruction will be processed for each
such group of arguments separately. The simplest example is to enclose one
argument name in square brackets:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro stoschar [char]
     {
        mov al,char
        stosb
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
This macroinstruction accepts unlimited number of arguments, and each one
will be processed into these two instructions separately. For example
<code>stoschar 1,2,3</code> will be assembled as the following instructions:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    mov al,1
    stosb
    mov al,2
    stosb
    mov al,3
    stosb
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
There are some special directives available only inside the definitions of
macroinstructions. <code>local</code> directive defines local names, which will be
replaced with unique values each time the macroinstruction is used. It should
be followed by names separated with commas. If the name given as parameter to <code>local</code> directive begins with a dot or two
dots, the unique labels generated by each evaluation of macroinstruction will
have the same properties. This directive is usually needed
for the constants or labels that macroinstruction defines and uses internally.
For example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro movstr
     {
        local move
      move:
        lodsb
        stosb
        test al,al
        jnz move
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
Each time this macroinstruction is used, <code>move</code> will become other unique name
in its instructions, so you will not get an error you normally get when some
label is defined more than once.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>forward</code>, <code>reverse</code> and <code>common</code> directives divide macroinstruction into
blocks, each one processed after the processing of previous is finished. They
differ in behavior only if macroinstruction allows multiple groups of
arguments. Block of instructions that follows <code>forward</code> directive is processed
for each group of arguments, from first to last - exactly like the default
block (not preceded by any of these directives). Block that follows <code>reverse</code>
directive is processed for each group of argument in reverse order - from last
to first. Block that follows <code>common</code> directive is processed only once,
commonly for all groups of arguments. Local name defined in one of the blocks
is available in all the following blocks when processing the same group of
arguments as when it was defined, and when it is defined in common block it is
available in all the following blocks not depending on which group of
arguments is processed.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Here is an example of macroinstruction that will create the table of
addresses to strings followed by these strings:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro strtbl name,[string]
     {
      common
        label name dword
      forward
        local label
        dd label
      forward
        label db string,0
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
First argument given to this macroinstruction will become the label for table
of addresses, next arguments should be the strings. First block is processed
only once and defines the label, second block for each string declares its
local name and defines the table entry holding the address to that string.
Third block defines the data of each string with the corresponding label.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The directive starting the block in macroinstruction can be followed by the
first instruction of this block in the same line, like in the following
example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro stdcall proc,[arg]
     {
      reverse push arg
      common call proc
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
This macroinstruction can be used for calling the procedures using STDCALL
convention, which has all the arguments pushed on stack in the reverse order. For example
<code>stdcall foo,1,2,3</code> will be assembled as:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    push 3
    push 2
    push 1
    call foo
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
If some name inside macroinstruction has multiple values (it is either one
of the arguments enclosed in square brackets or local name defined in the
block following <code>forward</code> or <code>reverse</code> directive) and is used in block
following the <code>common</code> directive, it will be replaced with all of its values,
separated with commas. For example the following macroinstruction will pass
all of the additional arguments to the previously defined <code>stdcall</code>
macroinstruction:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro invoke proc,[arg]
     { common stdcall [proc],arg }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
It can be used to call indirectly (by the pointer stored in memory) the
procedure using STDCALL convention.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Inside macroinstruction also special operator <code>#</code> can be used. This
operator causes two names to be concatenated into one name. It can be useful,
because it's done after the arguments and local names are replaced with their
values. The following macroinstruction will generate the conditional jump
according to the <code>cond</code> argument:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro jif op1,cond,op2,label
     {
        cmp op1,op2
        j#cond label
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
For example <code>jif ax,ae,10h,exit</code> will be assembled as <code>cmp ax,10h</code> and
<code>jae exit</code> instructions.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>#</code> operator can be also used to concatenate two quoted strings into one.
Also conversion of name into a quoted string is possible, with the <code>`</code> operator,
which likewise can be used inside the macroinstruction. It converts the name
that follows it into a quoted string - but note, that when it is followed by
a macro argument which is being replaced with value containing more than one
symbol, only the first of them will be converted, as the <code>`</code> operator converts
only one symbol that immediately follows it. Here's an example of utilizing
those two features:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro label name
     {
        label name
        if ~ used name
          display `name # " is defined but not used.",13,10
        end if
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
When label defined with such macro is not used in the source, macro will warn
you with the message, informing to which label it applies.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
To make macroinstruction behaving differently when some of the arguments are
of some special type, for example a quoted strings, you can use <code>eqtype</code>
comparision operator. Here's an example of utilizing it to distinguish a
quoted string from an other argument:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro message arg
     {
      if arg eqtype ""
        local str
        jmp   @f
        str   db arg,0Dh,0Ah,24h
        @@:
        mov   dx,str
      else
        mov   dx,arg
      end if
        mov   ah,9
        int   21h
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The above macro is designed for displaying messages in DOS programs. When the
argument of this macro is some number, label, or variable, the string from
that address is displayed, but when the argument is a quoted string, the
created code will display that string followed by the carriage return and
line feed.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
It is also possible to put a declaration of macroinstruction inside another
macroinstruction, so one macro can define another, but there is a problem
with such definitions caused by the fact, that <code>}</code> character cannot occur
inside the macroinstruction, as it always means the end of definition. To
overcome this problem, the escaping of symbols inside macroinstruction can be
used. This is done by placing one or more backslashes in
front of any other symbol (even the special character). Preprocessor sees such
sequence as a single symbol, but each time it meets such symbol during the
macroinstruction processing, it cuts the backslash character from the front of
it. For example <code>\}</code> is treated as single symbol, but during processing of the
macroinstruction it becomes the <code>}</code> symbol. This allows to put one definition
of macroinstruction inside another:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro ext instr
     {
      macro instr op1,op2,op3
       \{
        if op3 eq
          instr op1,op2
        else
          instr op1,op2
          instr op2,op3
        end if
       \}
     }

    ext add
    ext sub
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The macro <code>ext</code> is defined correctly, but when it is used, the <code>\{</code> and <code>\}</code>
become the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> symbols. So when the <code>ext&nbsp;add</code> is processed, the
contents of macro becomes valid definition of a macroinstruction and this way
the<code>add</code> macro becomes defined. In the same way<code>ext&nbsp;sub</code> defines the<code>sub</code>
macro. The use of <code>\{</code> symbol wasn't really necessary here, but it's done this
way to make the definition more clear.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
If some directives specific to macroinstructions, like <code>local</code> or <code>common</code>
are needed inside some macro embedded this way, they can be escaped in the same
way. Escaping the symbol with more than one backslash is also allowed, which
allows multiple levels of nesting the macroinstruction definitions.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The another technique for defining one macroinstruction by another is to
use the <code>fix</code> directive, which becomes useful when some macroinstruction only
begins the definition of another one, without closing it. For example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    macro tmacro [params]
     {
      common macro params {
     }

    MACRO fix tmacro
    ENDM fix }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
defines an alternative syntax for defining macroinstructions, which looks like:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    MACRO stoschar char
        mov al,char
        stosb
    ENDM
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
Note that symbol that has such customized definition must be defined with <code>fix</code>
directive, because only the prioritized symbolic constants are processed before
the preprocessor looks for the <code>}</code> character while defining the macro. This
might be a problem if one needed to perform some additional tasks one the end
of such definition, but there is one more feature which helps in such cases.
Namely it is possible to put any directive, instruction or  macroinstruction
just after the <code>}</code> character that ends the macroinstruction and it will be
processed in the same way as if it was put in the next line.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The "postpone" directive can be used to define a special type of
macroinstruction that has no name or arguments and will get automatically
called when the preprocessor reaches the end of source:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    postpone
     {
      code_size = $
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
It is a very simplified kind of macroinstruction and it simply delegates a
block of instructions to be put at the end.
</p>


<h4 id="2.3.4" class="smalltext">2.3.4  Structures</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>struc</code> directive is a special variant of <code>macro</code> directive that is used to
define data structures. Macroinstruction defined using the <code>struc</code> directive
must be preceded by a label (like the data definition directive) when it's
used. This label will be also attached at the beginning of every name starting
with dot in the contents of macroinstruction. The macroinstruction defined
using the <code>struc</code> directive can have the same name as some other
macroinstruction defined using the <code>macro</code> directive, structure
macroinstruction will not prevent the standard macroinstruction from being processed
when there is no label before it and vice versa. All the rules and features concerning
standard macroinstructions apply to structure macroinstructions.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Here is the sample of structure macroinstruction:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    struc point x,y
     {
        .x dw x
        .y dw y
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
For example <code>my point 7,11</code> will define structure labeled <code>my</code>, consisting of
two variables: <code>my.x</code> with value 7 and <code>my.y</code> with value 11.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
If somewhere inside the definition of structure the name consisting of a
single dot it found, it is replaced by the name of the label for the given
instance of structure and this label will not be defined automatically in
such case, allowing to completely customize the definition. The following
example utilizes this feature to extend the data definition directive <code>db</code>
with ability to calculate the size of defined data:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    struc db [data]
     {
       common
        . db data
        .size = $ - .
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
With such definition <code>msg db 'Hello!',13,10</code> will define also
<code>msg.size</code> constant, equal to the size of defined data in bytes.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Defining data structures addressed by registers or absolute values should be
done using the <code>virtual</code> directive with structure macroinstruction
(see <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#2.2.4">2.2.4</a>).
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>restruc</code> directive removes the last definition of the structure, just like
<code>purge</code> does with macroinstructions and <code>restore</code> with symbolic constants.
It also has the same syntax - should be followed by one or more names of
structure macroinstructions, separated with commas.
</p>

<h4 id="2.3.5" class="smalltext">2.3.5  Repeating macroinstructions</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
The <code>rept</code> directive is a special kind of macroinstruction, which makes given
amount of duplicates of the block enclosed with braces. The basic syntax is
<code>rept</code> directive followed by number. and then block of source enclosed between
the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> characters. The simplest example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    rept 5 { in al,dx }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
will make five duplicates of the <code>in al,dx</code> line. The block of instructions
is defined in the same way as for the standard macroinstruction and any
special operators and directives which can be used only inside
macroinstructions are also allowed here. When the given count is zero, the
block is simply skipped, as if you defined macroinstruction but never used
it. The number of repetitions can be followed by the name of counter symbol, which will get replaced
symbolically with the number of duplicate currently generated. So this:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    rept 3 counter
     {
        byte#counter db counter
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
will generate lines:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    byte1 db 1
    byte2 db 2
    byte3 db 3
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The repetition mechanism applied to <code>rept</code> blocks is the same as the one used
to process multiple groups of arguments for macroinstructions, so directives
like <code>forward</code>, <code>common</code> and <code>reverse</code> can be used in their usual meaning.
Thus such macroinstruction:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    rept 7 num { reverse display `num }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
will display digits from 7 to 1 as text. The <code>local</code> directive behaves in the
same way as inside macroinstruction with multiple groups of arguments, so:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    rept 21
     {
       local label
       label: loop label
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
will generate unique label for each duplicate.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The counter symbol by default counts from 1, but you can declare different
base value by placing the number preceded by colon immediately after the name
of counter. For example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    rept 8 n:0 { pxor xmm#n,xmm#n }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
will generate code which will clear the contents of eight SSE registers.
You can define multiple counters separated with commas, and each one can have
different base.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The number of repetitions and the base values for counters can be specified
using the numerical expressions with operator rules identical as in the case
of assembler. However each value used in such expression must either be a
directly specified number, or a symbolic constant with value also being an
expression that can be calculated by preprocessor (in such case the value
of expression associated with symbolic constant is calculated first, and then
substituted into the outer expression in place of that constant). If you need
repetitions based on values that can only be calculated at assembly time, use
one of the code repeating directives that are processed by assembler, see
section <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#2.2.3">2.2.3</a>.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>irp</code> directive iterates the single argument through the given list of
parameters. The syntax is <code>irp</code> followed by the argument name, then the comma
and then the list of parameters. The parameters are specified in the same
way like in the invocation of standard macroinstruction, so they have to be
separated with commas and each one can be enclosed with the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>
characters. Also the name of argument may be followed by <code>*</code> to mark that it
cannot get an empty value. Such block:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">   irp value, 2,3,5
    { db value }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
will generate lines:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">   db 2
   db 3
   db 5
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>irps</code> directive iterates through the given list of symbols, it should
be followed by the argument name, then the comma and then the sequence of any
symbols. Each symbol in this sequence, no matter whether it is the name
symbol, symbol character or quoted string, becomes an argument value for one
iteration. If there are no symbols following the comma, no iteration is done
at all. This example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">   irps reg, al bx ecx
    { xor reg,reg }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
will generate lines:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">   xor al,al
   xor bx,bx
   xor ecx,ecx
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>irpv</code> directive iterates through all of the values that were assigned to the given symbolic
variable. It should be followed by the argument name and the name of symbolic variable, separated with comma.
When the symbolic variable is treated with <code>restore</code> directive to remove its latest value, that value
is removed from the list of values accessed by <code>irpv</code>. But any modifications made to that list
during the iterations performed by <code>irpv</code>
(by either defining a new value for symbolic variable, or destroying the value with <code>restore</code> directive)
do not affect the operation performed by this directive - the list
that gets iterated reflects the state of symbolic variable at the time when <code>irpv</code> directive was encountered.
For example this snippet restores a symbolic variable called <code>d</code> to its initial state, before any
values were assigned to it:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">   irpv value, d
    { restore d }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
It simply generates as many copies of <code>restore</code> directive, as many values there are to remove.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The blocks defined by the <code>irp</code>, <code>irps</code> and <code>irpv</code> directives are also processed in
the same way as any macroinstructions, so operators and directives specific
to macroinstructions may be freely used also in this case.
</p>

<h4 id="2.3.6" class="smalltext">2.3.6  Conditional preprocessing</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
<code>match</code> directive causes some block of source to be preprocessed and passed
to assembler only when the given sequence of symbols matches the specified
pattern. The pattern comes first, ended with comma, then the symbols
that have to be matched with the pattern, and finally the block of
source, enclosed within braces as macroinstruction.
  There are the few rules for building the expression for matching, first is
that any of symbol characters and any quoted string should be matched exactly as is. In this example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    match +,+ { include 'first.inc' }
    match +,- { include 'second.inc' }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
the first file will get included, since <code>+</code> after comma matches the <code>+</code> in
pattern, and the second file will not be included, since there is no match.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
To match any other symbol literally, it has to be preceded by <code>=</code> character
in the pattern. Also to match the <code>=</code> character itself, or the comma, the
<code>==</code> and <code>=,</code> constructions have to be used. For example the <code>=a==</code> pattern
will match the <code>a=</code> sequence.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
If some name symbol is placed in the pattern, it matches any sequence
consisting of at least one symbol and then this name is replaced with the
matched sequence everywhere inside the following block, analogously to the
parameters of macroinstruction. For instance:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    match a-b, 0-7
     { dw a,b-a }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
will generate the <code>dw 0,7-0</code> instruction. Each name is always matched with
as few symbols as possible, leaving the rest for the following ones, so in
this case:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    match a b, 1+2+3 { db a }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
the <code>a</code> name will match the <code>1</code> symbol, leaving the <code>+2+3</code> sequence to be
matched with <code>b</code>. But in this case:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    match a b, 1 { db a }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
there will be nothing left for <code>b</code> to match, so the block will not get processed
at all.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The block of source defined by match is processed in the same way as any
macroinstruction, so any operators specific to macroinstructions can be used
also in this case.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
What makes <code>match</code> directive more useful is the fact, that it replaces the
symbolic constants with their values in the matched sequence of symbols (that
is everywhere after comma up to the beginning of the source block) before
performing the match. Thanks to this it can be used for example to process
some block of source under the condition that some symbolic constant has the
given value, like:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    match =TRUE, DEBUG { include 'debug.inc' }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
which will include the file only when the symbolic constant <code>DEBUG</code> was
defined with value <code>TRUE</code>.
</p>

<h4 id="2.3.7" class="smalltext">2.3.7  Order of processing</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
When combining various features of the preprocessor, it's important to know
the order in which they are processed. As it was already noted, the highest
priority has the <code>fix</code> directive and the replacements defined with it. This
is done completely before doing any other preprocessing, therefore this
piece of source:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    V fix {
      macro empty
       V
    V fix }
       V
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
becomes a valid definition of an empty macroinstruction. It can be interpreted
that the <code>fix</code> directive and prioritized symbolic constants are processed in
a separate stage, and all other preprocessing is done after on the resulting
source.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The standard preprocessing that comes after, on each line begins with
recognition of the first symbol. It starts with checking for the preprocessor
directives, and when none of them is detected, preprocessor checks whether the
first symbol is macroinstruction. If no macroinstruction is found, it moves
to the second symbol of line, and again begins with checking for directives,
which in this case is only the <code>equ</code> directive, as this is the only one that
occurs as the second symbol in line. If there is no directive, the second
symbol is checked for the case of structure macroinstruction and when none
of those checks gives the positive result, the symbolic constants are replaced
with their values and such line is passed to the assembler.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
To see it on the example, assume that there is defined the macroinstruction
called <code>foo</code> and the structure macroinstruction called <code>bar</code>. Those lines:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    foo equ
    foo bar
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
would be then both interpreted as invocations of macroinstruction <code>foo</code>, since
the meaning of the first symbol overrides the meaning of second one.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
When the macroinstruction generates the new lines from its definition block,
in every line it first scans for macroinstruction directives, and interpretes
them accordingly. All the other content in the definition block is used to
brew the new lines,
replacing the parameters with their values and then processing the symbol
escaping and <code>#</code> and <code>`</code>
operators. The conversion operator has the higher
priority than concatenation and if any of them operates on the escaped symbol,
the escaping is cancelled before finishing the operation. After this is
completed, the newly generated line goes through the standard preprocessing,
as described above.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Though the symbolic constants are usually only replaced in the lines, where
no preprocessor directives nor macroinstructions has been found, there are some
special cases where those replacements are performed in the parts of lines
containing directives. First one is the definition of symbolic constant, where
the replacements are done everywhere after the <code>equ</code> keyword and the resulting
value is then assigned to the new constant (see <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#2.3.2">2.3.2</a>). The second such case
is the <code>match</code> directive, where the replacements are done in the symbols
following comma before matching them with pattern. These features can be used
for example to maintain the lists, like this set of definitions:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    list equ

    macro append item
     {
       match any, list \{ list equ list,item \}
       match , list \{ list equ item \}
     }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>list</code> constant is here initialized with empty value, and the <code>append</code>
macroinstruction can be used to add the new items into this list, separating
them with commas. The first match in this macroinstruction occurs only when
the value of list is not empty (see <a href="http://flatassembler.net/docs.php?article=manual#2.3.6">2.3.6</a>), in such case the new value for the
list is the previous one with the comma and the new item appended at the end.
The second match happens only when the list is still empty, and in such case
the list is defined to contain just the new item. So starting with the empty
list, the <code>append&nbsp;1</code> would define <code>list&nbsp;equ&nbsp;1</code> and the <code>append&nbsp;2</code> following it
would define <code>list&nbsp;equ&nbsp;1,2</code>. One might then need to use this list as the
parameters to some macroinstruction. But it cannot be done directly - if <code>foo</code>
is the macroinstruction, then <code>foo&nbsp;list</code> would just pass the <code>list</code> symbol
as a parameter to macro, since symbolic constants are not unrolled at this
stage. For this purpose again <code>match</code> directive comes in handy:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    match params, list { foo params }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
The value of <code>list</code>, if it's not empty, matches the <code>params</code> keyword, which is
then replaced with matched value when generating the new lines defined by the
block enclosed with braces. So if the <code>list</code> had value <code>1,2</code>, the above line
would generate the line containing <code>foo&nbsp;1,2</code>, which would then go through the
standard preprocessing.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The other special case is in the parameters of <code>rept</code> directive. The amount
of repetitions and the base value for counter can be specified using
numerical expressions, and if there is a symbolic constant with non-numerical
name used in such an expression, preprocessor tries to evaluate its value as a numerical expression
and if succeeds, it replaces the symbolic constant with the result of that
calculation and continues to evaluate the primary expression. If the
expression inside that symbolic constants also contains some symbolic
constants, preprocessor will try to calculate all the needed values
recursively.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
This allows to perform some calculations at the time of preprocessing, as
long as all the values used are the numbers known at the preprocessing stage.
A single repetition with <code>rept</code> can be used for the sole purpose of
calculating some value, like in this example:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    define a b+4
    define b 3
    rept 1 result:a*b+2 { define c result }
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
To compute the base value for <code>result</code> counter, preprocessor replaces the <code>b</code>
with its value and recursively calculates the value of <code>a</code>, obtaining 7 as
the result, then it calculates the main expression with the result being 23.
The <code>c</code> then gets defined with the first value of counter (because the block
is processed just one time), which is the result of the computation, so the
value of <code>c</code> is simple <code>23</code> symbol. Note that if <code>b</code> is later redefined with
some other numerical value, the next time and expression containing <code>a</code> is
calculated, the value of <code>a</code> will reflect the new value of <code>b</code>, because the
symbolic constant contains just the text of the expression.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
There is one more special case - when preprocessor goes to checking the
second symbol in the line and it happens to be the colon character (what is
then interpreted by assembler as definition of a label), it stops in this
place and finishes the preprocessing of the first symbol (so if it's the
symbolic constant it gets unrolled) and if it still appears to be the label,
it performs the standard preprocessing starting from the place after the
label. This allows to place preprocessor directives and macroinstructions
after the labels, analogously to the instructions and directives processed
by assembler, like:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    start: include 'start.inc'
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
However if the label becomes broken during preprocessing (for example when
it is the symbolic constant with empty value), only replacing of the symbolic
constants is continued for the rest of line.
</p>



<p class="smalltext">
It should be remembered, that the jobs performed by preprocessor are the
preliminary operations on the texts symbols, that are done in a simple
single pass before the main process of assembly. The text that is the
result of preprocessing is passed to assembler, and it then does its
multiple passes on it. Thus the control directives, which are recognized and
processed only by the assembler - as they are dependent on the numerical
values that may even vary between passes - are not recognized in any way by
the preprocessor and have no effect on the preprocessing. Consider this
example source:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    if 0
    a = 1
    b equ 2
    end if
    dd b
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
When it is preprocessed, they only directive that is recognized by the
preprocessor is the <code>equ</code>, which defines symbolic constant <code>b</code>, so later
in the source the <code>b</code> symbol is replaced with the value <code>2</code>. Except for this
replacement, the other lines are passes unchanged to the assembler. So
after preprocessing the above source becomes:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    if 0
    a = 1
    end if
    dd 2
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
Now when assembler processes it, the condition for the <code>if</code> is false, and
the <code>a</code> constant doesn't get defined. However symbolic constant <code>b</code> was
processed normally, even though its definition was put just next to the one
of <code>a</code>. So because of the possible confusion you should be very careful
every time when mixing the features of preprocessor and assembler - in such
cases it is important to realize what the source will become after the
preprocessing, and thus what the assembler will see and do its multiple passes on.

<h3 id="2.4" class="mediumtext">2.4  Formatter directives</h3>

<p class="smalltext">
These directives are actually also a kind of control directives, with the
purpose of controlling the format of generated code.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>format</code> directive followed by the format identifier allows to select the
output format. This directive should be put at the beginning of the source.
Default output format is a flat binary file, it can also be selected by using
<code>format binary</code> directive.
This directive can be followed by the <code>as</code> keyword
and the quoted string specifying the default file extension for the output
file. Unless the output file name was specified from the command line,
assembler will use this extension when generating the output file.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>use16</code> and <code>use32</code> directives force the assembler to generate 16-bit or
32-bit code, omitting the default setting for selected output format.
<code>use64</code> enables generating the code for the long mode of x86-64 processors.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
Below are described different output formats with the directives specific to
these formats.
</p>

<h4 id="2.4.1" class="smalltext">2.4.1  MZ executable</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
To select the MZ output format, use <code>format MZ</code> directive. The default code
setting for this format is 16-bit.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>segment</code> directive defines a new segment, it should be followed by label,
which value will be the number of defined segment, optionally <code>use16</code> or
<code>use32</code> word can follow to specify whether code in this segment should be
16-bit or 32-bit. The origin of segment is aligned to paragraph (16 bytes).
All the labels defined then will have values relative to the beginning of this
segment.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>entry</code> directive sets the entry point for MZ executable, it should be
followed by the far address (name of segment, colon and the offset inside
segment) of desired entry point.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>stack</code> directive sets up the stack for MZ executable. It can be followed by
numerical expression specifying the size of stack to be created automatically
or by the far address of initial stack frame when you want to set up the stack
manually. When no stack is defined, the stack of default size 4096 bytes will
be created.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>heap</code> directive should be followed by a 16-bit value defining maximum size
of additional heap in paragraphs (this is heap in addition to stack and
undefined data). Use <code>heap 0</code> to always allocate only memory program really
needs. Default size of heap is 65535.
</p>

<h4 id="2.4.2" class="smalltext">2.4.2  Portable Executable</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
To select the Portable Executable output format, use <code>format PE</code> directive, it
can be followed by additional format settings: first the target subsystem
setting, which can be <code>console</code> or <code>GUI</code> for Windows applications, <code>native</code>
for Windows drivers, <code>EFI</code>, <code>EFIboot</code> or <code>EFIruntime</code> for the UEFI, it may be
followed by the minimum version of system that the executable is targeted to
(specified in form of floating-point value). Optional <code>DLL</code> and <code>WDM</code> keywords
mark the output file as a dynamic link library and WDM driver respectively,
the <code>large</code> keyword marks the executable as able to handle addresses
larger than 2 GB and the <code>NX</code> keyword signalizes that the executable conforms to the
restriction of not executing code residing in non-executable sections.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
After those settings can follow the <code>at</code> operator and the numerical expression
specifying the base of PE image and then optionally <code>on</code> operator followed by
the quoted string containing file name selects custom MZ stub for PE program
(when specified file is not a MZ executable, it is treated as a flat binary
executable file and converted into MZ format). The default code setting for
this format is 32-bit. The example of fully featured PE format declaration:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    format PE GUI 4.0 DLL at 7000000h on 'stub.exe'
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
To create PE file for the x86-64 architecture, use <code>PE64</code> keyword instead of
<code>PE</code> in the format declaration, in such case the long mode code is generated
by default.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>section</code> directive defines a new section, it should be followed by quoted
string defining the name of section, then one or more section flags can
follow. Available flags are: <code>code</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>readable</code>, <code>writeable</code>,
<code>executable</code>, <code>shareable</code>, <code>discardable</code>, <code>notpageable</code>.
The origin of section is aligned to page (4096 bytes). Example declaration of PE section:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    section '.text' code readable executable
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
Among with flags also one of the special PE data identifiers can be specified to mark the whole
section as a special data, possible identifiers are <code>export</code>, <code>import</code>,
<code>resource</code> and <code>fixups</code>. If the section is marked to contain fixups, they are
generated automatically and no more data needs to be defined in this section.
Also resource data can be generated automatically from the resource file, it
can be achieved by writing the <code>from</code> operator and quoted file name after the
<code>resource</code> identifier. Below are the examples of sections containing some special PE data:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    section '.reloc' data readable discardable fixups
    section '.rsrc' data readable resource from 'my.res'
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>entry</code> directive sets the entry point for Portable Executable, the value of
entry point should follow.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>stack</code> directive sets up the size of stack for Portable Executable, value
of stack reserve size should follow, optionally value of stack commit
separated with comma can follow. When stack is not defined, it's set by
default to size of 4096 bytes.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>heap</code> directive chooses the size of heap for Portable Executable, value of
heap reserve size should follow, optionally value of heap commit separated
with comma can follow. When no heap is defined, it is set by default to size
of 65536 bytes, when size of heap commit is unspecified, it is by default set
to zero.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>data</code> directive begins the definition of special PE data, it should be
followed by one of the data identifiers (<code>export</code>, <code>import</code>, <code>resource</code> or
<code>fixups</code>) or by the number of data entry in PE header. The data should be
defined in next lines, ended with <code>end data</code> directive. When fixups data
definition is chosen, they are generated automatically and no more data needs
to be defined there. The same applies to the resource data when the <code>resource</code>
identifier is followed by <code>from</code> operator and quoted file name - in such case
data is  taken from the given resource file.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>rva</code> operator can be used inside the numerical expressions to obtain
the RVA of the item addressed by the value it is applied to, that is the
offset relative to the base of PE image.
</p>


<h4 id="2.4.3" class="smalltext">2.4.3  Common Object File Format</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
To select Common Object File Format, use <code>format COFF</code> or <code>format MS COFF</code>
directive, depending whether you want to create classic (DJGPP) or Microsoft's variant of COFF file.
The default code setting for this format is 32-bit. To create the file in
Microsoft's COFF format for the x86-64 architecture, use <code>format MS64 COFF</code>
setting, in such case long mode code is generated by default.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>section</code> directive defines a new section, it should be followed by quoted
string defining the name of section, then one or more section flags can
follow.
Section flags available for both COFF variants are <code>code</code> and <code>data</code>,
while flags <code>readable</code>, <code>writeable</code>, <code>executable</code>, <code>shareable</code>, <code>discardable</code>,
<code>notpageable</code>, <code>linkremove</code> and <code>linkinfo</code> are available only with
Microsoft's COFF variant.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
By default section is aligned to double word (four bytes), in case of Microsoft COFF variant other alignment
can be specified by providing the <code>align</code> operator followed by alignment value
(any power of two up to 8192) among the section flags.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>extrn</code> directive defines the external symbol, it should be followed by the
name of symbol and optionally the size operator specifying the size of data
labeled by this symbol. The name of symbol can be also preceded by quoted
string containing name of the external symbol and the <code>as</code> operator.
Some example declarations of external symbols:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    extrn exit
    extrn '__imp__MessageBoxA@16' as MessageBox:dword
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>public</code> directive declares the existing symbol as public, it should be
followed by the name of symbol, optionally it can be followed by the <code>as</code>
operator and the quoted string containing name under which symbol should be
available as public.
Some examples of public symbols declarations:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    public main
    public start as '_start'
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
Additionally, with COFF format it's possible to specify exported symbol as
static, it's done by preceding the name of symbol with the <code>static</code> keyword.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
When using the Microsoft's COFF format, the <code>rva</code> operator can be used
inside the numerical expressions to obtain the RVA of the item addressed by the
value it is applied to.
</p>

<h4 id="2.4.4" class="smalltext">2.4.4  Executable and Linkable Format</h4>

<p class="smalltext">
To select ELF output format, use <code>format ELF</code> directive. The default code
setting for this format is 32-bit. To create ELF file for the x86-64
architecture, use <code>format ELF64</code> directive, in such case the long mode code is
generated by default.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>section</code> directive defines a new section, it should be followed by quoted
string defining the name of section, then can follow one or both of the
<code>executable</code> and <code>writeable</code> flags, optionally also <code>align</code> operator followed
by the number specifying the alignment of section (it has to be the power of
two), if no alignment is specified, the default value is used, which is 4 or 8,
depending on which format variant has been chosen.
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
<code>extrn</code> and <code>public</code> directives have the same meaning and syntax as when the
COFF output format is selected (described in previous section).
</p>
<p class="smalltext">
The <code>rva</code> operator can be used also in the case of this format (however not
when target architecture is x86-64), it converts the address into the offset
relative to the GOT table, so it may be useful to create position-independent
code. There's also a special <code>plt</code> operator, which allows to call the external
functions through the Procedure Linkage Table. You can even create an alias
for external function that will make it always be called through PLT, with
the code like:
</p>
<pre class="smallcode">    extrn 'printf' as _printf
    printf = PLT _printf
</pre>
<p class="smalltext">
To create executable file, follow the format choice directive with the <code>executable</code> keyword and optionally the number specifying the brand of the target operating system
(for example value 3 would mark the executable for Linux systems).
With this format selected it is allowed to use <code>entry</code> directive followed by the value to set as entry point of
program. On the other hand it makes <code>extrn</code> and
<code>public</code> directives unavailable, and instead of <code>section</code> there should be the
<code>segment</code> directive used, followed by one or more segment permission
flags and optionally a marker of special ELF executable segment, which can be <code>interpreter</code>,
<code>dynamic</code> or <code>note</code>.
The origin of segment is aligned to page (4096 bytes), and available permission
flags are: <code>readable</code>, <code>writeable</code> and <code>executable</code>.
